Rust, tell me about what first parameter of method to be self and if it's implicit or needs to be specified

In Rust, the first parameter of a method is always self, which represents the instance of the struct or enum on which the method is being called. The self parameter is used to access and manipulate the fields and other methods of the instance within the method body.

When defining a method, you need to explicitly specify the self parameter. There are three forms of self that you can use depending on how you want to access the instance:

    self: This is the most common form and is used when you want to borrow the instance immutably. It allows you to read the instance's fields but not modify them. The method takes ownership of self for the duration of the method call.

Example:

rust

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

    &mut self: This form is used when you want to borrow the instance mutably. It allows you to read and modify the instance's fields. The method takes a mutable reference to self.

Example:

rust

impl Rectangle {
    fn set_width(&mut self, width: u32) {
        self.width = width;
    }
}

    self: This form is used when you want to transfer ownership of the instance to the method. The method takes ownership of self and can consume it or transfer ownership elsewhere.

Example:

rust

impl Rectangle {
    fn square(self) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle {
            width: self.width,
            height: self.width,
        }
    }
}

In all three forms, you need to explicitly specify the self parameter when defining the method. However, when calling the method on an instance, you don't need to pass the self parameter explicitly. Rust automatically infers and passes the instance as the self parameter based on the method call syntax.

For example:

rust

let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
let area = rect.area(); // Calling the method, `self` is implicitly passed

I hope this clarifies the concept of self as the first parameter in Rust methods and how it needs to be specified when defining the method.

You stated 'let area = rect.area();'. Where is area method?

Apologies for the confusion. In the previous example, I did define the area method for the Rectangle struct. Here's the complete example with the area method:

rust

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
    let area = rect.area(); // Calling the area method
    println!("Area: {}", area);
}

In this example:

    The Rectangle struct is defined with width and height fields.
    The area method is defined within an impl block for the Rectangle struct. It takes an immutable reference to self (&self) and returns the area of the rectangle by multiplying self.width and self.height.
    In the main function, an instance of Rectangle named rect is created with a width of 10 and a height of 20.
    The area method is called on the rect instance using the dot notation (rect.area()). Rust automatically passes the rect instance as the self parameter to the area method.
    The result of the area method is stored in the area variable.
    Finally, the area is printed using println!.

When you run this code, it will output:

Area: 200

The area method is defined within the impl block for the Rectangle struct, allowing instances of Rectangle to call the area method using the dot notation.

I apologize for any confusion caused by the previous example. Let me know if you have any further questions!

Let say, area method also include second and third params. 'impl Rectangle { fn area(&self) -> u32 { self.width * self.height } }'.

And I call 'let area = rect.area(second, third);', does it mean the first param 'self' is still called implicitly?

Yes, even if the area method includes additional parameters, the first parameter self is still implicitly passed when calling the method using the dot notation.

Let's modify the example to include second and third parameters in the area method:

rust

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self, multiplier: u32, offset: u32) -> u32 {
        (self.width * self.height) * multiplier + offset
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
    let area = rect.area(2, 5); // Calling the area method with additional arguments
    println!("Area: {}", area);
}

In this updated example:

    The area method is modified to take two additional parameters: multiplier and offset. The method now calculates the area by multiplying the width and height, then multiplying the result by multiplier, and finally adding offset.
    In the main function, when calling the area method using rect.area(2, 5), the rect instance is implicitly passed as the first argument for the self parameter. The values 2 and 5 are explicitly passed as the second and third arguments for the multiplier and offset parameters, respectively.

When you run this code, it will output:

Area: 405

The calculation is performed as follows:

    self.width * self.height evaluates to 10 * 20, which is 200.
    200 * multiplier evaluates to 200 * 2, which is 400.
    400 + offset evaluates to 400 + 5, which is 405.

So, even though the area method has additional parameters, the first parameter self is still implicitly passed when calling the method using the dot notation. The rect instance is automatically passed as the self argument, and you only need to provide the values for the additional parameters explicitly.

You stated: 'let area = rect.area(2, 5); // Calling the area method with additional arguments'. How do I have supply self param in the method when I use the method?

some thing like :

'rect.area(myRectangle, 2, 5)'

In Rust, when you call a method using the dot notation, you don't need to explicitly pass the self parameter. The instance on which the method is called (in this case, rect) is automatically passed as the self argument to the method.

If you try to explicitly pass the self parameter like rect.area(myRectangle, 2, 5), it will result in a compile-time error because Rust expects the method to be called on an instance directly.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

rust

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self, multiplier: u32, offset: u32) -> u32 {
        (self.width * self.height) * multiplier + offset
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };
    let my_rectangle = rect;

    // Incorrect: Explicitly passing `self` parameter
    // let area = rect.area(my_rectangle, 2, 5);

    // Correct: Calling the method on the instance directly
    let area = rect.area(2, 5);

    println!("Area: {}", area);
}

In this example, the line let area = rect.area(my_rectangle, 2, 5); is commented out because it would result in a compile-time error. The error message would be something like:

error[E0616]: method `area` has 3 parameters but the declaration in trait `Rectangle` has 4
  --> src/main.rs:16:19
   |
3  |     fn area(&self, multiplier: u32, offset: u32) -> u32 {
   |     ---------------------------------------------------- expected `fn(&Rectangle, u32, u32) -> u32 {Rectangle::area}` but found `fn(Rectangle, Rectangle, u32, u32) -> u32 {Rectangle::area}`
...
16 |     let area = rect.area(my_rectangle, 2, 5);
   |                    ^^^^  ------------ help: remove this argument
   |
   = note: expected fn pointer `fn(&Rectangle, u32, u32) -> u32 {Rectangle::area}`
              found fn pointer `fn(Rectangle, Rectangle, u32, u32) -> u32 {Rectangle::area}`

The error message indicates that the method area expects 3 parameters (&self, multiplier, and offset), but the declaration in the Rectangle trait has 4 parameters (an additional Rectangle parameter is being passed explicitly).

To correctly call the method, you should use let area = rect.area(2, 5);, which calls the area method on the rect instance directly, passing only the required additional arguments (multiplier and offset). Rust automatically passes rect as the self argument.

I hope this clarifies how the self parameter is implicitly passed when calling methods in Rust using the dot notation.

so, the self param of method in impl is used to call fields in the strurct

Yes, that's correct! The self parameter in the method definition within an impl block is used to access the fields and other methods of the struct or enum on which the method is defined.

When you define a method within an impl block, the first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct or enum. By convention, it is named self, but you could technically choose a different name (although it's not recommended to do so for clarity and consistency).

The self parameter allows you to access the fields of the struct using the dot notation, like self.field_name. It also allows you to call other methods defined on the same struct using self.method_name().

Here's an example that illustrates accessing fields and calling other methods using self:

rust

struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn is_square(&self) -> bool {
        self.width == self.height
    }

    fn double_dimensions(&mut self) {
        self.width *= 2;
        self.height *= 2;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut rect = Rectangle { width: 10, height: 20 };

    println!("Area: {}", rect.area());
    println!("Is square? {}", rect.is_square());

    rect.double_dimensions();
    println!("New dimensions: {} x {}", rect.width, rect.height);
}

In this example:

    The area method uses self.width and self.height to access the width and height fields of the Rectangle instance and calculate the area.
    The is_square method uses self.width and self.height to check if the rectangle is a square by comparing its width and height.
    The double_dimensions method uses &mut self to mutably borrow the Rectangle instance and modify its width and height fields by doubling their values.
    In the main function, the methods are called on the rect instance using the dot notation, like rect.area(), rect.is_square(), and rect.double_dimensions(). The self parameter is implicitly passed as the rect instance.

When you run this code, it will output:

Area: 200
Is square? false
New dimensions: 20 x 40

So, the self parameter allows you to access and manipulate the fields and call other methods of the struct within the method body. It provides a way to work with the instance's data and behavior.
