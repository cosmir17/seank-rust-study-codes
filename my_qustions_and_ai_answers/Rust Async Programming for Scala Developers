The knowledge shared by an experienced developer in the Scala Discord channel helped me understand the differences and similarities between Rust and Scala async programming.

Certainly! Here are some paragraphs summarizing the key points and knowledge shared in this thread about Rust async programming from a Scala developer's perspective:

1. Rust and Scala have different approaches to async programming, which can lead to confusion for Scala developers transitioning to Rust. In Scala, the `Future` and `IO` types are commonly used for asynchronous computations, while Rust uses the `Future` trait and the `async`/`await` syntax.

2. Rust's `Future` is semantically closer to Cats Effect's `IO` than Scala's `Future`. Both `Future` in Rust and `IO` in Cats Effect represent the actual computation, whereas Scala's `Future` is a handle to a running computation.

3. Rust's `.await` syntax is used to access the result of an asynchronous computation, similar to the `<-` operator in Scala's `for` comprehensions. However, `.await` is not directly equivalent to Scala's `map` or `flatMap` operations.

4. Under the hood, Rust translates `async`/`await` to a state machine, which is driven by the executor using the `Future` trait protocol. This allows for efficient memory usage and avoids unnecessary allocations. In contrast, Scala's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` are typically implemented using callbacks and may involve more allocations.

5. Rust developers often write async code in an imperative style, using `.await` to handle the results of asynchronous operations. Scala developers, accustomed to functional programming, may find this style less intuitive and prefer using `map`, `flatMap`, and `for` comprehensions to handle async computations.

6. The difference in approach and mindset between Rust and Scala developers can be attributed to Rust's emphasis on systems programming, performance, and low-level control, which promotes a more imperative and pragmatic coding style.

7. While Rust's async programming model may seem foreign to Scala developers at first, understanding the underlying concepts and semantics can help bridge the gap. Drawing parallels between Rust's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO`, and recognizing the similarities between `.await` and `<-`, can aid in the learning process.

elaborate as much as you can with examples, please?


Certainly! Let's dive deeper into how Rust's `async`/`await` is translated to a state machine and compare it with Scala's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` implementations.

Rust's `async`/`await`:
In Rust, when you define an async function using the `async` keyword, the compiler translates it into a state machine. The state machine represents the different states of the asynchronous computation and the transitions between them. Each `.await` point in the async function marks a potential suspension point where the execution can be paused and resumed later.

Here's a simple example of an async function in Rust:

```rust
async fn fetch_data() -> Result<String, Error> {
    let data = fetch_from_database().await?;
    Ok(process_data(data))
}
```

Under the hood, the Rust compiler generates a state machine for this async function. The state machine has two states: one before the `.await` and one after it. The executor, which is responsible for running the async tasks, uses the `Future` trait protocol to poll the state machine and drive its execution forward.

When the `.await` point is reached, if the data is not yet available, the execution is suspended, and the control is returned to the executor. The executor can then poll other async tasks and resume the execution of this task when the data becomes available. This allows for efficient utilization of system resources and avoids blocking the execution.

Scala's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO`:
In Scala, the `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` are typically implemented using callbacks. When you define a computation using `Future` or `IO`, you provide a callback that will be executed when the computation completes.

Here's an example using Scala's `Future`:

```scala
def fetchData(): Future[String] = {
  fetchFromDatabase().flatMap { data =>
    Future.successful(processData(data))
  }
}
```

In this example, `flatMap` is used to chain the computations. The callback passed to `flatMap` will be executed when the `fetchFromDatabase()` future completes. The result of the computation is then wrapped in a `Future.successful` to create a new future.

Similarly, with Cats Effect's `IO`:

```scala
def fetchData(): IO[String] = {
  fetchFromDatabase().flatMap { data =>
    IO(processData(data))
  }
}
```

The `IO` type in Cats Effect represents an asynchronous computation that can be run explicitly. The `flatMap` operation is used to chain computations, and the callback passed to `flatMap` will be executed when the `fetchFromDatabase()` IO completes.

In both cases, the callbacks are stored within the `Future` or `IO` instances, and the execution is driven by the underlying runtime or execution context. This callback-based approach may involve more allocations compared to Rust's state machine approach, as each callback typically captures its own closure and requires memory allocation.

The main difference is that Rust's `async`/`await` is translated to a state machine at compile-time, allowing for more efficient memory usage and execution, while Scala's `Future` and `IO` rely on callbacks and may involve more runtime overhead.

It's worth noting that both Rust and Scala have their own advantages and trade-offs. Rust's approach is particularly well-suited for systems programming and low-level control, while Scala's approach provides a more high-level and compositional way of working with asynchronous computations.





S
When I said examples, I meant, the actual code details of the state machine and Rust Future trait executor for Rust async programming. So that, I would know .await won't be actually blocking in Rust code.

Also, the actual code details of Scala's Future and Cats Effect's IO so that I would know they are using callbacks and may involve more allocations.


Apologies for the confusion. Let's dive into the actual code details of Rust's state machine and Future trait executor, as well as Scala's Future and Cats Effect's IO implementations.

Rust's State Machine and Future Trait Executor:
In Rust, the async/await syntax is built on top of the Future trait. When you define an async function, the Rust compiler generates a state machine that implements the Future trait.

Here's a simplified example of how the state machine and Future trait executor work in Rust:

```rust
trait Future {
    type Output;
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output>;
}

enum Poll<T> {
    Ready(T),
    Pending,
}

struct MyFuture {
    state: u32,
}

impl Future for MyFuture {
    type Output = ();

    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        match self.state {
            0 => {
                self.state = 1;
                cx.waker().wake_by_ref();
                Poll::Pending
            }
            1 => {
                // Perform some work
                self.state = 2;
                Poll::Pending
            }
            2 => {
                // Work completed
                Poll::Ready(())
            }
            _ => unreachable!(),
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MyFuture` struct represents the state machine. The `state` field keeps track of the current state of the asynchronous computation. The `Future` trait defines the `poll` method, which is called by the executor to drive the computation forward.

Inside the `poll` method, a `match` statement is used to determine the current state and perform the corresponding actions. When the computation is not yet complete, `Poll::Pending` is returned, indicating that the future is not ready. The executor will then schedule the future to be polled again later. When the computation is complete, `Poll::Ready` is returned with the result.

The executor is responsible for calling the `poll` method on the futures and driving the computation forward. It manages the scheduling and execution of the futures based on their readiness.

Scala's Future and Cats Effect's IO:
In Scala, the `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` are implemented using callbacks and a runtime or execution context.

Here's a simplified example of how Scala's `Future` works:

```scala
trait Future[+T] {
  def onComplete[U](callback: Try[T] => U)(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Unit
}

object Future {
  def apply[T](body: => T)(implicit executor: ExecutionContext): Future[T] = {
    val promise = Promise[T]()
    executor.execute(() => {
      try {
        val result = body
        promise.success(result)
      } catch {
        case NonFatal(e) => promise.failure(e)
      }
    })
    promise.future
  }
}
```

In this example, the `Future` trait defines the `onComplete` method, which takes a callback that will be invoked when the future completes. The `Future.apply` method is used to create a new future. It takes a block of code (`body`) that will be executed asynchronously.

Inside `Future.apply`, a `Promise` is created, which is a writeable, single-assignment container for a future result. The `body` is executed asynchronously using the provided `ExecutionContext`. When the `body` completes successfully, the result is set on the promise using `promise.success`. If an exception occurs, the promise is completed with a failure using `promise.failure`.

The resulting future is obtained from the promise using `promise.future`.

Cats Effect's `IO` is similar in concept but provides additional features and a more powerful abstraction for asynchronous and effectful computations.

Here's a simplified example of how Cats Effect's `IO` works:

```scala
sealed trait IO[+A] {
  def flatMap[B](f: A => IO[B]): IO[B] = FlatMap(this, f)
  def map[B](f: A => B): IO[B] = flatMap(a => Pure(f(a)))
}

case class Pure[A](a: A) extends IO[A]
case class Delay[A](thunk: () => A) extends IO[A]
case class FlatMap[A, B](ioa: IO[A], f: A => IO[B]) extends IO[B]

object IO {
  def apply[A](a: => A): IO[A] = Delay(() => a)
}
```

In this example, the `IO` trait represents an asynchronous computation. It defines the `flatMap` and `map` methods for composing and transforming `IO` instances.

The `Pure` case class represents a pure value wrapped in an `IO`. The `Delay` case class represents a delayed computation that will be executed when the `IO` is run. The `FlatMap` case class represents the composition of two `IO` instances using `flatMap`.

The `IO.apply` method is used to create a new `IO` instance from a block of code. It wraps the code block in a `Delay`, which will be executed when the `IO` is run.

When the `IO` is run, the computation is triggered, and the result is produced. The execution of an `IO` can be managed and optimized by the runtime system.

Both Scala's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` use callbacks and involve allocations for each computation step. The callbacks are stored within the `Future` or `IO` instances and are triggered when the computation completes.

It's important to note that Scala's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` are high-level abstractions that provide a more functional and compositional approach to asynchronous programming, while Rust's async/await and state machine approach is lower-level and more focused on performance and control.




S
Now, I have the low level details how it works. With these details, explain to me 'Rust's Future is semantically closer to Cats Effect's IO than Scala's Future. Both Future in Rust and IO in Cats Effect represent the actual computation, whereas Scala's Future is a handle to a running computation.'

Certainly! Let's explore how Rust's `Future` is semantically closer to Cats Effect's `IO` than Scala's `Future`, and how they represent the actual computation differently.

Rust's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` represent the actual computation:

1. Rust's `Future`:
   In Rust, a `Future` represents an asynchronous computation that will eventually produce a value. It is a value that can be polled by an executor to drive the computation forward. The `Future` trait defines the `poll` method, which is called by the executor to make progress on the computation.

   When you create an async function in Rust, it returns a `Future`. This `Future` encapsulates the entire computation, including all the intermediate steps and state transitions. The computation is only executed when the `Future` is polled by the executor.

   Rust's `Future` is lazy and doesn't start executing until it is polled. It represents the actual computation itself, not just a handle to a running computation.

2. Cats Effect's `IO`:
   Similarly, in Cats Effect, an `IO` represents an asynchronous computation that can be executed to produce a value. It is a data structure that describes the computation and can be composed and transformed using operations like `map` and `flatMap`.

   When you create an `IO` in Cats Effect, it represents the entire computation, including all the steps and effects that need to be performed. The computation is only executed when the `IO` is run by the runtime system.

   Like Rust's `Future`, Cats Effect's `IO` is lazy and doesn't start executing until it is explicitly run. It represents the actual computation itself, encapsulating all the effects and steps required to produce the final value.

Scala's `Future` is a handle to a running computation:

1. Scala's `Future`:
   In contrast, Scala's `Future` represents a computation that has already been started and is running concurrently. When you create a `Future`, the computation is immediately started, and the `Future` acts as a handle to the running computation.

   The `Future` itself doesn't contain the actual computation steps or state. Instead, it provides a way to register callbacks (`onComplete`, `map`, `flatMap`) that will be invoked when the computation completes.

   Scala's `Future` is eager and starts executing as soon as it is created. It represents a handle to a running computation, not the computation itself.

The key difference is that Rust's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` are lazy and represent the actual computation, while Scala's `Future` is eager and represents a handle to a running computation.

This difference in semantics has implications for how the computations are composed and executed:

- With Rust's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO`, you have more control over when the computation is executed. You can compose and transform the computations using combinators like `map` and `flatMap` without actually starting the execution. The execution only happens when the `Future` is polled or the `IO` is run.

- With Scala's `Future`, the computation starts immediately, and you can only register callbacks to be invoked when the computation completes. You have less control over the execution itself, as it has already been started.

In summary, Rust's `Future` and Cats Effect's `IO` are semantically closer because they both represent the actual computation and provide a way to control and compose the computation before it is executed. Scala's `Future`, on the other hand, represents a handle to a running computation and has a different semantic model.




S
You explained to me as
"""
Rust's State Machine and Future Trait Executor:.................
"""
However, you didn't explain how '.await' and 'async def methodName(...)' fit into this flow.


Apologies for the oversight. Let me explain how `.await` and `async fn` fit into the flow of Rust's async/await programming model.

1. `async fn`:
   In Rust, you define an asynchronous function using the `async fn` syntax. When you mark a function as `async`, it means that the function will return a `Future` that represents the asynchronous computation.

   Here's an example of an async function:

   ```rust
   async fn my_async_function() -> Result<String, Error> {
       // Asynchronous code here
       Ok("Hello, world!".to_string())
   }
   ```

   When `my_async_function` is called, it immediately returns a `Future` that represents the asynchronous computation. The actual execution of the function body is deferred until the `Future` is polled by the executor.

2. `.await`:
   Inside an async function, you can use the `.await` syntax to wait for the completion of another `Future`. When you `.await` a `Future`, it means that the current async function will yield control back to the executor until the awaited `Future` completes.

   Here's an example of using `.await`:

   ```rust
   async fn my_async_function() -> Result<String, Error> {
       let result = some_other_async_function().await;
       Ok(result)
   }
   ```

   In this example, `my_async_function` calls `some_other_async_function` and uses `.await` to wait for its completion. If `some_other_async_function` returns a `Future` that is not yet ready, the execution of `my_async_function` will be suspended at the `.await` point, and control will be yielded back to the executor.

   The executor will then continue executing other tasks or futures that are ready. When the awaited `Future` completes, the executor will resume the execution of `my_async_function` from the point where it was suspended.

Now, let's see how `async fn` and `.await` fit into the state machine and `Future` trait:

1. When you define an `async fn`, the Rust compiler generates a state machine that implements the `Future` trait behind the scenes. Each `.await` point in the async function corresponds to a state in the state machine.

2. When the async function is called, it returns a `Future` that encapsulates the state machine. The `Future` starts in the initial state of the state machine.

3. The executor polls the `Future` by calling the `poll` method. Inside the `poll` method, the state machine progresses based on the current state and the result of any awaited `Future`s.

4. If an `.await` is encountered and the awaited `Future` is not ready, the state machine transitions to a waiting state, and `Poll::Pending` is returned. The executor will then schedule the `Future` to be polled again later.

5. When the awaited `Future` completes, the executor resumes the execution of the state machine from the waiting state. The state machine then continues executing the next steps after the `.await` point.

6. The process continues until the state machine reaches a final state, indicating that the async function has completed. At this point, `Poll::Ready` is returned with the result of the async function.

So, `async fn` and `.await` provide a high-level and expressive way to define and compose asynchronous computations in Rust. Under the hood, the Rust compiler transforms the async/await code into a state machine that implements the `Future` trait, which can be polled and driven by the executor.

This allows for efficient and cooperative multitasking, where the executor can switch between different `Future`s based on their readiness, without blocking the execution of other tasks.





S
You stated

"""

1. Each .await point in the async function corresponds to a state in the state machine.

The executor polls the Future by calling the poll method.
"""

You didn't explain to me how these two are connected in terms of the code details.


Apologies for not providing a clear connection between the `.await` points and the `poll` method in terms of code details. Let me explain how they are related.

When you have an async function with `.await` points, the Rust compiler generates a state machine that implements the `Future` trait. Each `.await` point corresponds to a state in the state machine, and the transitions between states are determined by the completion of the awaited `Future`s.

Here's an example to illustrate the connection:

```rust
async fn my_async_function() -> Result<String, Error> {
    let result1 = some_async_function1().await;
    let result2 = some_async_function2(result1).await;
    Ok(result2)
}
```

In this example, `my_async_function` has two `.await` points. The Rust compiler will generate a state machine with three states:

1. Initial state: Before the first `.await` point.
2. Waiting state: After the first `.await` point, waiting for `some_async_function1` to complete.
3. Waiting state: After the second `.await` point, waiting for `some_async_function2` to complete.

Now, let's see how the `poll` method of the `Future` trait interacts with these states:

```rust
impl Future for MyAsyncFunctionFuture {
    type Output = Result<String, Error>;

    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        match self.state {
            State::Initial => {
                let future1 = some_async_function1();
                self.state = State::Waiting1(future1);
                cx.waker().wake_by_ref();
                Poll::Pending
            }
            State::Waiting1(ref mut future1) => {
                match future1.poll(cx) {
                    Poll::Ready(result1) => {
                        let future2 = some_async_function2(result1);
                        self.state = State::Waiting2(future2);
                        cx.waker().wake_by_ref();
                        Poll::Pending
                    }
                    Poll::Pending => Poll::Pending,
                }
            }
            State::Waiting2(ref mut future2) => {
                match future2.poll(cx) {
                    Poll::Ready(result2) => Poll::Ready(Ok(result2)),
                    Poll::Pending => Poll::Pending,
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this generated `poll` method, the state machine is represented by a `match` expression on the `self.state` field. Each state corresponds to an `.await` point in the original async function.

1. When the `poll` method is called in the initial state, it starts executing `some_async_function1()` and transitions to the `State::Waiting1` state. It returns `Poll::Pending` to indicate that the `Future` is not ready yet.

2. When the `poll` method is called in the `State::Waiting1` state, it polls the `future1` returned by `some_async_function1()`. If `future1` is ready, it starts executing `some_async_function2()` with the result of `future1` and transitions to the `State::Waiting2` state. If `future1` is not ready, it returns `Poll::Pending`.

3. When the `poll` method is called in the `State::Waiting2` state, it polls the `future2` returned by `some_async_function2()`. If `future2` is ready, it returns `Poll::Ready` with the final result. If `future2` is not ready, it returns `Poll::Pending`.

The `cx.waker().wake_by_ref()` calls are used to register the waker with the executor, so that the executor knows to poll the `Future` again when the awaited `Future`s are ready.

So, the `.await` points in the async function correspond to the different states in the generated state machine, and the `poll` method of the `Future` trait drives the execution of the state machine by polling the awaited `Future`s and transitioning between states based on their completion.

This is how the `.await` points and the `poll` method are connected in the generated code for an async function in Rust.



S
When I said 'two are connected', I meant .await and the executor.
Also, you stated
"""
When you have an async function with .await points, the Rust compiler generates a state machine that implements the Future trait.
"""
You didn't tell me how .await generates a state machine. Is .await method a macro? if so, can you give me code details?


I apologize for the confusion. Let me clarify the connection between `.await` and the executor, and explain how `.await` is related to the state machine generation.

1. Connection between `.await` and the executor:
   When you use `.await` in an async function, it is a suspension point. When the execution reaches an `.await`, it checks if the awaited `Future` is ready. If the `Future` is not ready, the async function is suspended, and control is yielded back to the executor.

   The executor is then responsible for polling the awaited `Future` and driving its execution forward. When the awaited `Future` completes, the executor resumes the execution of the async function from the point where it was suspended.

   So, `.await` and the executor are connected through the suspension and resumption of the async function. `.await` allows the async function to yield control back to the executor when it needs to wait for a `Future` to complete, and the executor is responsible for managing the execution and resumption of the async function.

2. `.await` and state machine generation:
   `.await` is not a macro in Rust. It is a language keyword that is used as part of the async/await syntax. The Rust compiler has built-in support for handling `.await` expressions and generating the corresponding state machine.

   When the Rust compiler encounters an async function, it analyzes the function body and identifies the `.await` points. For each `.await` point, the compiler generates a new state in the state machine.

   The compiler then transforms the async function into a state machine that implements the `Future` trait. The state machine captures the local variables and the progress of the function execution at each `.await` point.

   Here's a simplified representation of how the compiler might transform an async function with `.await` into a state machine:

   ```rust
   async fn my_async_function() -> Result<String, Error> {
       let result1 = some_async_function1().await;
       let result2 = some_async_function2(result1).await;
       Ok(result2)
   }
   ```

   The compiler generates a state machine similar to this:

   ```rust
   enum State {
       Initial,
       Waiting1(Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<String, Error>>>>),
       Waiting2(Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<String, Error>>>>),
   }

   struct MyAsyncFunctionFuture {
       state: State,
   }

   impl Future for MyAsyncFunctionFuture {
       type Output = Result<String, Error>;

       fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
           // ... (poll implementation similar to the previous example)
       }
   }
   ```

   In this generated code, the `State` enum represents the different states of the state machine, corresponding to the `.await` points in the async function.

   The `MyAsyncFunctionFuture` struct holds the current state of the state machine, and the `poll` method implements the logic for transitioning between states based on the completion of the awaited `Future`s.

   So, `.await` is not a macro, but the Rust compiler has built-in support for transforming async functions with `.await` into state machines that implement the `Future` trait.

   The `.await` keyword is a signal to the compiler to generate the necessary state transitions and suspension points in the state machine, allowing the async function to yield control back to the executor when needed.

I hope this clarifies the connection between `.await` and the executor, and how `.await` is related to the state machine generation in Rust.





S
You stated that 'It is a language keyword that is used as part of the async/await syntax. The Rust compiler has built-in support for handling .await expressions and generating the corresponding state machine.'
Where is the compiler code generating?

The Rust compiler, which is written in Rust itself, contains the code for generating the state machine from async functions with `.await` expressions. The compilation process involves several stages, including parsing, type checking, and code generation.

The specific code for handling `.await` expressions and generating the corresponding state machine is part of the compiler's code generation logic. It is implemented within the Rust compiler codebase.

In the Rust compiler's source code, the code generation for async functions and `.await` expressions is handled by the `rustc_codegen_ssa` crate, which is responsible for generating the lower-level intermediate representation (IR) of the code.

The relevant code generation logic can be found in the `rustc_codegen_ssa/src/mir/mod.rs` file, specifically in the `codegen_async_fn` function. This function is responsible for transforming the MIR (Mid-level Intermediate Representation) of an async function into the appropriate state machine representation.

Here's a simplified overview of the code generation process for async functions and `.await` expressions:

1. The Rust compiler parses the source code and builds the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

2. The AST is then lowered into the MIR, which is a more detailed representation of the code that includes control flow and type information.

3. The `codegen_async_fn` function in `rustc_codegen_ssa/src/mir/mod.rs` takes the MIR of an async function and transforms it into a state machine representation.

4. The state machine is generated based on the `.await` expressions in the async function. Each `.await` expression corresponds to a state in the state machine.

5. The generated state machine code is then further processed and optimized by the compiler.

6. Finally, the compiler generates the executable machine code from the optimized state machine representation.

The actual code generation process involves various phases and optimizations performed by the Rust compiler. The specific details of how the state machine is generated and optimized can be quite complex and may vary depending on the version of the Rust compiler.

If you want to explore the Rust compiler's source code and dive deeper into the implementation details of async/await code generation, you can refer to the Rust compiler's codebase on GitHub: [https://github.com/rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

Keep in mind that the Rust compiler's codebase is a large and complex project, and understanding the intricacies of the code generation process requires a deep knowledge of compiler internals and the Rust language itself.

In summary, the Rust compiler's code generation logic for async functions and `.await` expressions is implemented within the `rustc_codegen_ssa` crate, specifically in the `codegen_async_fn` function. This function is responsible for transforming the MIR representation of an async function into the corresponding state machine code.





S
I think what happens is :

once the compiler creates the state machine code with MIR
the executor runs .poll method in that code
it goes through the pattern matching in the state machine

Do you think if it's correct?
My second question is what is running the executor in the background? Tokio runtime?



Your understanding of the process is correct! Let me clarify and provide some additional details.

1. State machine generation:
   - When the Rust compiler encounters an async function, it generates the state machine code using the MIR (Mid-level Intermediate Representation).
   - The `.await` expressions in the async function are transformed into state transitions in the generated state machine code.
   - The state machine code is then further processed and optimized by the compiler.

2. Executor and polling:
   - The generated state machine code implements the `Future` trait, which defines the `poll` method.
   - An executor, such as the Tokio runtime or the `async-std` runtime, is responsible for running and managing the execution of async tasks.
   - The executor repeatedly calls the `poll` method on the `Future` returned by the async function.
   - Each call to `poll` advances the state machine by executing the code associated with the current state.

3. Pattern matching in the state machine:
   - Inside the generated `poll` method, there is typically a `match` expression that matches on the current state of the state machine.
   - Each arm of the `match` expression corresponds to a specific state and contains the code to be executed in that state.
   - The `match` expression determines the appropriate action to take based on the current state, such as awaiting on a sub-future, updating the state, or returning the final result.

Regarding your second question, the executor is indeed running in the background, and it is typically provided by the runtime you are using, such as Tokio or `async-std`.

In the case of Tokio, the Tokio runtime is responsible for running the executor. When you use Tokio to run your async code, it sets up the necessary runtime environment, including the executor, and manages the execution of async tasks.

The Tokio runtime provides an event loop that continuously polls the registered `Future`s and drives their execution forward. It efficiently manages the scheduling and execution of async tasks, allowing for concurrent and non-blocking I/O operations.

Similarly, other async runtimes like `async-std` also provide their own executors to run and manage async tasks.

When you use these runtimes to run your async code, they handle the background execution of the executor, which in turn polls the `Future`s and advances the state machines generated by the Rust compiler.

So, in summary:
1. The Rust compiler generates the state machine code with MIR based on the async function and `.await` expressions.
2. The executor, provided by the runtime (e.g., Tokio), runs the `poll` method on the `Future` returned by the async function.
3. The `poll` method advances the state machine by executing the code associated with the current state, typically using pattern matching.
4. The executor, running in the background, continuously polls the `Future`s and drives their execution forward, managing the scheduling and execution of async tasks.

The specific runtime you choose, such as Tokio or `async-std`, provides the necessary infrastructure and executor to run your async code efficiently.





.await is keyword reserved by the compiler like 'for' keyword.
.await is not a macro.
