No, Rust does not have a built-in `groupBy` method like some other programming languages. However, you can achieve similar functionality using the `fold` or `collect` methods in combination with a `HashMap` or `BTreeMap`.

Here's an example of how you can group elements of an iterator by a key using `fold` and `HashMap`:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let words = vec!["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "apple", "banana", "elderberry"];

let grouped: HashMap<&str, Vec<&str>> = words.iter().fold(HashMap::new(), |mut acc, &word| {
    acc.entry(word).or_default().push(word);
    acc
});

println!("{:?}", grouped);
```

Output:
```
{"apple": ["apple", "apple"], "banana": ["banana", "banana"], "cherry": ["cherry"], "date": ["date"], "elderberry": ["elderberry"]}
```

In this example:
1. We have a vector of words `words`.
2. We use `fold` to iterate over each word in `words` and accumulate the result in a `HashMap` called `grouped`.
3. For each word, we use `acc.entry(word).or_default()` to get a mutable reference to the entry for that word in the `HashMap`. If the entry doesn't exist, `or_default()` initializes it with an empty `Vec`.
4. We push the current word into the corresponding `Vec` using `push(word)`.
5. Finally, we print the `grouped` map, which contains the words grouped by their keys.

Alternatively, you can use `collect` with `HashMap` and a tuple as the key:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let words = vec!["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "apple", "banana", "elderberry"];

let grouped: HashMap<&str, Vec<&str>> = words.iter().map(|&word| (word, word)).collect();

println!("{:?}", grouped);
```

This approach collects the elements into a `HashMap` directly, using each word as both the key and value in a tuple.

While Rust doesn't have a built-in `groupBy` method, you can achieve the same functionality using these techniques with `fold`, `collect`, and `HashMap` or `BTreeMap`.
