Rust programming, what's the relationship between async-std and tokio

Rust is a systems programming language that provides built-in support for asynchronous programming. `async-std` and `tokio` are both popular asynchronous runtime libraries in the Rust ecosystem that allow you to write asynchronous code and handle concurrent tasks efficiently. Here's a comparison of the two:

1. Purpose:
   - `async-std` aims to provide a standard library for asynchronous programming in Rust, similar to the standard library for synchronous programming.
   - `tokio` is a runtime library that focuses on providing a robust and efficient asynchronous runtime for Rust applications.

2. Compatibility:
   - `async-std` is designed to be compatible with the Rust standard library and provides asynchronous versions of many standard library types and functions.
   - `tokio` has its own set of types and utilities that are optimized for asynchronous programming, and it may require some adaptation of existing code to work with `tokio`.

3. Performance:
   - Both `async-std` and `tokio` offer high-performance asynchronous runtimes.
   - `tokio` is known for its optimized implementation and has been heavily focused on performance, making it a popular choice for high-performance applications.

4. Ecosystem and Adoption:
   - `tokio` has a larger and more mature ecosystem, with a wide range of libraries and frameworks built on top of it.
   - `async-std` is a newer library compared to `tokio` but has been gaining popularity and has a growing ecosystem.

5. API and Syntax:
   - `async-std` aims to provide an API that is similar to the Rust standard library, making it easier to transition from synchronous to asynchronous programming.
   - `tokio` has its own API and syntax, which may require a learning curve for developers who are new to the library.

In summary, both `async-std` and `tokio` are powerful asynchronous runtime libraries for Rust. `async-std` focuses on providing a standard library-like experience for asynchronous programming, while `tokio` emphasizes performance and has a larger ecosystem. The choice between the two often depends on the specific requirements of your project, personal preferences, and the libraries and frameworks you plan to use.

It's worth noting that it's possible to use both `async-std` and `tokio` together in the same project, as they can coexist and interoperate to some extent. However, it's generally recommended to choose one runtime library and stick with it for consistency and simplicity in your codebase.
