In Rust, the choice between using a channel or a mutex to sync state depends on your specific use case and requirements. Both approaches have their strengths and considerations. Let's explore each option:

1. Using a channel:
   - Channels provide a way to communicate between tasks, allowing you to send and receive data.
   - You can have a single task that owns the state and exposes a channel for other tasks to fetch and modify the latest data.
   - Other tasks can send requests through the channel to retrieve the current state or request modifications.
   - The state-owning task processes these requests, updates the state, and sends back the updated state or acknowledgment.
   - Channels enforce a message-passing style of communication, which can help maintain clear ownership and avoid shared mutable state.
   - Channels are useful when you have multiple tasks that need to access the state concurrently and you want to centralize the state management.

2. Using a mutex:
   - Mutexes (mutual exclusion locks) allow multiple tasks to safely access and modify shared mutable state.
   - You can wrap the shared state inside a mutex and lock the mutex whenever a task needs to access or modify the state.
   - Mutexes ensure that only one task can access the shared state at a time, preventing race conditions.
   - Tasks need to lock the mutex, perform the necessary operations on the state, and then unlock the mutex.
   - Mutexes are useful when multiple tasks need to directly access and modify the shared state without the overhead of message passing.

Considerations:
- Performance: Channels involve message passing and potentially copying data, which can have some overhead compared to directly accessing shared state with a mutex. However, the performance impact depends on the specific use case and the frequency of state access.
- Complexity: Using channels can lead to a more complex design, especially if you have multiple types of requests or need to handle request-response patterns. Mutexes provide a simpler and more direct way to manage shared state.
- Ownership and safety: Channels enforce a clear ownership model, where the state is owned by a single task and accessed through message passing. This can make it easier to reason about the state and avoid shared mutable state issues. Mutexes require careful management to prevent deadlocks and ensure proper locking and unlocking.

Ultimately, the choice between channels and mutexes depends on your specific requirements, the complexity of your state management, and the level of concurrency needed. If you have a simple shared state and multiple tasks need to access and modify it directly, using a mutex might be sufficient. If you have a more complex state management scenario or need to centralize the state handling, using channels with a dedicated state-managing task can be a good approach.

It's worth noting that there are also other synchronization primitives and patterns available in Rust, such as RwLock (for read-write locks), atomics, and more. The choice depends on the specific needs of your application.






You raise a valid point about the difference between channels and mutexes in terms of their behavior and synchronization guarantees.

When using channels, especially buffered channels, there can be a delay between sending a message and the receiver processing it, as messages are queued in the channel. This means that if you send a message to change a boolean flag (e.g., to disable a certain behavior), the change may not take effect immediately if there are pending messages in the channel queue. This can be problematic in scenarios where immediate synchronization is required, such as security-related checks.

In contrast, mutexes provide immediate synchronization. When a task locks a mutex and modifies the shared state, the changes are instantly visible to other tasks that subsequently lock the mutex. There is no queue involved, and the state is always up to date.

Your solution of using two channels with biased selection is an interesting approach to prioritize the processing of certain messages over others. By using `biased;`, you ensure that the first channel (`bool_rx`) is always checked first before the second channel (`msg_rx`). This allows you to give priority to messages that change the `allow` flag.

However, as you mentioned, this approach can become complex and may feel like reinventing the mutex functionality using channels. It adds overhead and complexity compared to directly using a mutex for synchronization.

In situations where immediate synchronization is crucial, such as enabling/disabling certain behaviors based on a flag, using a mutex is often a simpler and more straightforward solution. Mutexes provide the necessary synchronization primitives to ensure that the shared state is always up to date and consistently accessed by multiple tasks.

That being said, there are scenarios where channels can be a good fit for synchronization, especially when you have a clear producer-consumer pattern or when you need to distribute work among multiple tasks. Channels excel in enabling communication and coordination between tasks, particularly when there is a natural flow of data or events.

As @Conrad "luscious locks" Ludgate mentioned, you can use unbuffered channels (with a capacity of 0) to achieve synchronous communication between tasks. This means that the sender will block until the receiver is ready to receive the message, ensuring immediate synchronization. However, this approach may not be suitable if you have a high volume of messages or if blocking the sender is not desirable. In "0 buffered channels" are referring to Go's channel behavior. While the general concept is similar, Rust's channels are typically buffered by default. You can create an unbuffered channel in Rust using `std::sync::mpsc::sync_channel(0)`.

Ultimately, the choice between channels and mutexes depends on your specific synchronization requirements, the nature of your application, and the trade-offs you are willing to make between simplicity, performance, and synchronization guarantees.






Apologies for the confusion. Let me provide a Rust-specific comparison of channels, mutexes, and actors:

1. Channels in Rust:
   - Rust provides built-in support for channels through the `std::sync::mpsc` module (`mpsc` stands for "multi-producer, single-consumer").
   - Channels in Rust are typed, ensuring that only specific types of messages can be sent and received.
   - They are used for communication and synchronization between threads, allowing safe and efficient message passing.
   - Rust's ownership system and borrow checker ensure that channel usage is free from common concurrency bugs like data races and memory corruption.
   - Channels can be used to implement various concurrency patterns, such as producer-consumer, pipeline, and work distribution.

2. Mutexes in Rust:
   - Rust provides the `std::sync::Mutex` type for mutual exclusion.
   - A mutex is used to protect shared mutable state from being accessed concurrently by multiple threads.
   - The `Mutex<T>` type provides an RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) guard called `MutexGuard`, which automatically locks the mutex when created and unlocks it when destroyed.
   - Rust's ownership system and borrow checker ensure that mutexes are used safely, preventing data races and other concurrency issues.
   - Mutexes in Rust are often used in combination with the `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting) type to allow shared ownership of the mutex across multiple threads.

3. Actors in Rust (using the Actix framework):
   - Actix is a popular actor framework for Rust that provides an implementation of the actor model.
   - Actors in Actix are lightweight, isolated units of computation that communicate through message passing.
   - Each actor has its own state and can receive messages, process them, and send messages to other actors.
   - Actix actors are built on top of Rust's ownership system and leverage Rust's concurrency primitives like threads and channels.
   - Actors in Actix can be used to build concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems.
   - Actix provides additional features like actor supervision, fault tolerance, and message routing.
   - However, using actors introduces a different programming model and may have a learning curve compared to using channels and mutexes directly.

When choosing between channels, mutexes, and actors in Rust, consider the following:
- If you need to communicate and synchronize between threads, channels are a lightweight and efficient choice.
- If you have shared mutable state that needs to be protected from concurrent access, mutexes provide a simple and safe way to achieve that.
- If you are building a complex concurrent or distributed system and want a higher-level abstraction with additional features like fault tolerance and supervision, using an actor framework like Actix can be beneficial.

Keep in mind that Rust's ownership system and borrow checker help ensure the safety and correctness of concurrent code, regardless of whether you choose channels, mutexes, or actors.

It's common to use a combination of these concurrency primitives in a Rust application, depending on the specific requirements and architecture of your system. Channels and mutexes are part of Rust's standard library, while actors are provided by external frameworks like Actix.
