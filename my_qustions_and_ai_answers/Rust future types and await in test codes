Hello, I have the following Rust codes :


Copy code
use crate::helpers::{assert_is_redirect_to, spawn_app};

#[tokio::test]
async fn you_must_be_logged_in_to_access_the_admin_dashboard() {
    // Arrange

    // Act - Part 1 - Login
    let login_body = serde_json::json!({
        "username": &app.test_user.username,
        "password": &app.test_user.password
    });
    let response = app.post_login(&login_body).await;
    assert_is_redirect_to(&response, "/admin/dashboard");

    // Act - Part 2 - Follow the redirect

    assert_is_redirect_to(&response, "/login");

    // Act - Part 4 - Follow the redirect

}
Can you break down each line where await is used? what are the types for each '.await' and why Rust always breaks down from '.await' rather than using '.map.?

Certainly! Let's break down each line where .await is used and discuss the types and the reason for using .await instead of .map.

let app = spawn_app().await;
spawn_app() is a function that returns a Future representing the asynchronous operation of spawning the application.
The .await is used to wait for the Future to complete and get the result, which is assigned to the app variable.
The type of app depends on the return type of the spawn_app() function.
let response = app.get_admin_dashboard().await;
app.get_admin_dashboard() is a method call that returns a Future representing the asynchronous operation of making a GET request to the admin dashboard endpoint.
The .await is used to wait for the Future to complete and get the result, which is assigned to the response variable.
The type of response is likely a response type from an HTTP client library, such as reqwest::Response or hyper::Response.
let response = app.post_login(&login_body).await;
app.post_login(&login_body) is a method call that returns a Future representing the asynchronous operation of making a POST request to the login endpoint with the provided login_body.
The .await is used to wait for the Future to complete and get the result, which is assigned to the response variable.
The type of response is likely a response type from an HTTP client library, similar to the previous example.
let html_page = app.get_admin_dashboard_html().await;
app.get_admin_dashboard_html() is a method call that returns a Future representing the asynchronous operation of making a GET request to the admin dashboard endpoint and extracting the HTML content.
The .await is used to wait for the Future to complete and get the result, which is assigned to the html_page variable.
The type of html_page is likely a String or a similar type representing the HTML content.
let response = app.post_logout().await;
app.post_logout() is a method call that returns a Future representing the asynchronous operation of making a POST request to the logout endpoint.
The .await is used to wait for the Future to complete and get the result, which is assigned to the response variable.
The type of response is likely a response type from an HTTP client library, similar to the previous examples.
let html_page = app.get_login_html().await;
app.get_login_html() is a method call that returns a Future representing the asynchronous operation of making a GET request to the login endpoint and extracting the HTML content.
The .await is used to wait for the Future to complete and get the result, which is assigned to the html_page variable.
The type of html_page is likely a String or a similar type representing the HTML content.
let response = app.get_admin_dashboard().await;
This line is similar to the previous occurrences of app.get_admin_dashboard().await, where it makes a GET request to the admin dashboard endpoint and waits for the response.
In Rust, .await is used instead of .map because .await is specifically designed for working with Futures and asynchronous code. When you use .await, the execution of the current function is suspended until the Future completes, and the result is obtained. This allows for writing asynchronous code in a sequential manner, making it easier to reason about the flow of execution.

On the other hand, .map is used for synchronous operations and transformations on values, such as iterators or Option and Result types. It applies a function to the value and returns a new value without blocking the execution.

Using .await instead of .map in asynchronous code allows for a more idiomatic and expressive way of handling asynchronous operations in Rust.

When I said 'why Rust always breaks down from '.await' rather than using '.map.?', I was comparing with Scala

I apologize for the confusion. When you mentioned comparing with Scala, I should have considered the context of Scala's Future and its usage of map.

In Scala, when working with Future, it is common to use map to transform the result of a Future once it completes. Scala's Future is a monadic construct, which allows for chaining operations using map, flatMap, and other combinators. This enables a more functional programming style where you can compose asynchronous operations without explicitly blocking the execution.

Here's an example in Scala:

scala


Copy code
val futureResult = fetchData().map(data => processData(data))
In this case, fetchData() returns a Future, and map is used to transform the result of the Future once it completes, applying the processData function to the data.

In contrast, Rust's async/await syntax is built around the concept of Futures, but it follows a more imperative style. Instead of using combinators like map, Rust uses the await keyword to suspend the execution until a Future completes and then continues with the result.

Here's an example in Rust:

rust


Copy code
let data = fetch_data().await;
let processed_data = process_data(data);
In this case, fetch_data() returns a Future, and await is used to wait for the Future to complete and obtain the result. The execution is suspended until the Future completes, and then the result is assigned to the data variable. The process_data function is then called with the obtained data.

The difference in approach between Scala and Rust can be attributed to their different programming paradigms and the design choices made in each language. Scala leans more towards functional programming and uses combinators like map to compose asynchronous operations, while Rust follows a more imperative style with the await keyword to handle asynchronous operations.

Both approaches have their merits and are designed to make asynchronous programming more manageable in their respective languages. Scala's Future with map allows for a more functional and composable style, while Rust's async/await provides a more straightforward and imperative way of handling asynchronous operations.

You stated 'Rust uses the await keyword to suspend the execution until a Future completes and then continues with the result.'. Does it mean it's a blocking call?

No, using await in Rust does not block the execution of the entire program or the thread. Instead, it suspends the execution of the current function until the Future being awaited completes, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.

When a function reaches an await point, the Rust runtime checks if the Future being awaited is already complete. If it is, the execution continues immediately with the result. If the Future is not yet complete, the function's execution is suspended, and the control is handed back to the Rust runtime. The runtime can then proceed to execute other tasks or Futures that are ready to run.

Once the Future being awaited completes, the runtime resumes the execution of the suspended function from where it left off, with the result of the Future. This allows for concurrent execution of multiple asynchronous operations without blocking the entire program.

It's important to note that await is used within an async context, such as an async fn or an async block. The async keyword is used to mark a function or block as asynchronous, indicating that it may contain await expressions and can be executed concurrently with other tasks.

Here's an example to illustrate the non-blocking nature of await:

rust


Copy code
async fn fetch_data() -> String {
    // Simulating an asynchronous operation
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
    "Data".to_string()
}

async fn main() {
    println!("Before awaiting fetch_data()");
    let data = fetch_data().await;
    println!("After awaiting fetch_data(), data: {}", data);
}
In this example, the fetch_data function simulates an asynchronous operation that takes 2 seconds to complete. When fetch_data().await is called, the execution of the main function is suspended, but the program doesn't block. The Rust runtime can continue executing other tasks concurrently.

After 2 seconds, when the Future returned by fetch_data() completes, the execution of main resumes, and the result is assigned to the data variable. The program then proceeds to print the value of data.

So, while await suspends the execution of the current function, it does not block the entire program or the thread, allowing for efficient utilization of system resources and concurrent execution of multiple asynchronous operations.

In the example that you provided, the code behaves in the same as the one without 'async' keyword?

You're correct. In the example I provided, the behavior of the code would be the same even without the async keyword. Let me explain why.

When you have a single asynchronous operation like fetch_data() and you await it in the main function, the execution of main will be suspended until fetch_data() completes. During this time, the program will not make any progress because there are no other asynchronous operations or tasks to execute concurrently.

Here's the equivalent code without the async keyword:

rust


Copy code
fn fetch_data() -> String {
    // Simulating a blocking operation
    std::thread::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2));
    "Data".to_string()
}

fn main() {
    println!("Before calling fetch_data()");
    let data = fetch_data();
    println!("After calling fetch_data(), data: {}", data);
}
In this version, fetch_data() is a regular blocking function that uses std::thread::sleep to simulate a blocking operation that takes 2 seconds. When fetch_data() is called in main, the execution of main will be blocked until fetch_data() completes.

The output of both versions of the code will be similar:


Copy code
Before awaiting fetch_data()  // or Before calling fetch_data()
// 2-second delay
After awaiting fetch_data(), data: Data  // or After calling fetch_data(), data: Data
The benefit of using async/await becomes apparent when you have multiple asynchronous operations that can be executed concurrently. By using async/await, you can write asynchronous code that allows for concurrent execution, making more efficient use of system resources.

Here's an example that demonstrates the benefit of async/await:

rust


Copy code
async fn fetch_data_async(id: i32) -> String {
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
    format!("Data {}", id)
}

async fn main() {
    let futures = vec![
        fetch_data_async(1),
        fetch_data_async(2),
        fetch_data_async(3),
    ];

    let results = futures::future::join_all(futures).await;

    for data in results {
        println!("Data: {}", data);
    }
}
In this example, we have multiple calls to fetch_data_async with different id values. By using futures::future::join_all, we can execute these asynchronous operations concurrently. The main function will await the completion of all the futures before proceeding to print the results.

With async/await, the total execution time will be close to 2 seconds (the duration of a single fetch_data_async call), as the operations are executed concurrently. In contrast, if we were to use blocking operations, the total execution time would be around 6 seconds (2 seconds for each fetch_data call), as they would be executed sequentially.

So, while the simple example I provided earlier didn't showcase the benefits of async/await, in real-world scenarios where you have multiple asynchronous operations, using async/await can lead to more efficient and concurrent execution of code.

In Rust, developers use '.await' whenever they need access to the internal objects unlike Scala's frameworks (web server etc) take Future from a code chain written by developer, the frameworks handle Future internally

You're right! In Rust, the use of .await is more explicit and controlled by the developer, whereas in Scala, frameworks often handle Futures internally.

In Rust, when you have an asynchronous operation that returns a Future, you need to explicitly use .await to suspend the execution and wait for the Future to complete. This gives you fine-grained control over the asynchronous flow of your code. You decide where and when to .await the completion of a Future, allowing you to write asynchronous code that closely resembles synchronous code.

For example, in a Rust web framework like actix-web, you would define an asynchronous handler function that takes a request and returns a Future representing the response. You would use .await within the handler function to wait for the completion of any asynchronous operations, such as making a database query or an external API call.

rust


Copy code
async fn handler(req: HttpRequest) -> impl Responder {
    let result = fetch_data_from_db().await;
    match result {
        Ok(data) => HttpResponse::Ok().json(data),
        Err(_) => HttpResponse::InternalServerError().finish(),
    }
}
In this example, fetch_data_from_db() returns a Future, and we use .await to wait for the database query to complete before proceeding to generate the appropriate HTTP response.

On the other hand, in Scala, frameworks like Akka HTTP or Play Framework often handle Futures internally. You define your route handlers or controller actions, and the framework takes care of managing the asynchronous execution and composition of Futures.

For example, in Akka HTTP, you can define a route that returns a Future[T], and the framework will automatically handle the completion of the Future and send the response to the client.

scala


Copy code
val route = path("data") {
  get {
    complete(fetchDataFromDb())
  }
}

def fetchDataFromDb(): Future[Seq[Data]] = {
  // Asynchronous database query
  db.run(dataTable.result)
}
In this case, fetchDataFromDb() returns a Future[Seq[Data]], but you don't explicitly use map or flatMap to handle the Future. Instead, you return the Future, and Akka HTTP takes care of managing its completion and sending the response.

The Scala frameworks abstract away some of the asynchronous handling and composition, making it more convenient to work with Futures in certain scenarios. However, this abstraction can sometimes make the asynchronous flow less explicit compared to Rust's .await approach.

Both approaches have their merits and trade-offs. Rust's explicit .await gives you more control and makes the asynchronous flow more visible, while Scala's framework-managed Futures can provide a higher level of abstraction and convenience in certain cases.

Your previous code example :

"""

async fn fetch_data_async(id: i32) -> String {

tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2)).await;

format!("Data {}", id)

}

async fn main() {

let futures = vec![

fetch_data_async(1),

fetch_data_async(2),

fetch_data_async(3),

];

let results = futures::future::join_all(futures).await;

for data in results {

println!("Data: {}", data);

}

}

"""

When does the code actually runs what's in the futures? 'join_all' or '.await'?

In the code example I provided, the actual execution of the futures happens when .await is called on futures::future::join_all(futures).

Let's break it down step by step:

In the main function, we create a vector of futures by calling fetch_data_async with different id values:
rust


Copy code
let futures = vec![
    fetch_data_async(1),
    fetch_data_async(2),
    fetch_data_async(3),
];
At this point, the fetch_data_async functions are not actually executed. Instead, we are creating three separate Futures that represent the asynchronous operations to be performed.
We then pass the vector of futures to futures::future::join_all:
rust


Copy code
let results = futures::future::join_all(futures).await;
join_all is a function provided by the futures crate that takes an iterator of Futures and returns a new Future. This new Future represents the collective completion of all the input futures. When the returned Future completes, it yields a collection of the results of the individual futures in the same order as they were provided. However, at this point, the futures are still not being executed. They are just bundled together into a single Future by join_all.
The actual execution of the futures happens when .await is called on the Future returned by join_all:
rust


Copy code
let results = futures::future::join_all(futures).await;
When .await is used, the execution of the main function is suspended, and the Rust runtime starts executing the futures concurrently. Each fetch_data_async call will be executed asynchronously, allowing them to run concurrently. The .await will wait for all the futures to complete before continuing the execution of main. Once all the futures are completed, the results are collected into the results variable, which is a collection of the returned values from each fetch_data_async call.
Finally, we iterate over the results and print each data value:
rust


Copy code
for data in results {
    println!("Data: {}", data);
}
This will print the data returned by each fetch_data_async call.
So, to summarize, the actual execution of the futures happens when .await is called on the Future returned by futures::future::join_all. The .await triggers the concurrent execution of the futures and waits for their completion before proceeding with the rest of the code.
