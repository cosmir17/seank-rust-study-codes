Why does a.map produces Map type?

Edit
In Rust, the map method is a higher-order function that applies a given closure (anonymous function) to each element of an iterator and returns a new iterator with the transformed elements.

When you call a.map(...), the map method doesn't produce a Map type. Instead, it returns a new iterator that yields the transformed elements produced by applying the closure to each element of the original iterator a.

In your code:

rust

Copy code
let b = a.map(|(name, &weight)| {
    let sum = name
        .chars()
        .map(|c| c.to_ascii_uppercase() as usize - 64)
        .sum::<usize>()
        + name.len();
    let winning_number = sum as i32 * weight;
    (name.to_string(), winning_number)
});
The map closure takes a tuple (name, &weight) from the a iterator (which was created by e.zip(we.iter())). The closure performs some calculations on name and weight and returns a new tuple (name.to_string(), winning_number).

The map operation creates a new iterator b that yields these new tuples (String, i32) for each element in the original a iterator.

So, b is not a Map type; it's an iterator that produces (String, i32) tuples. The type of b is an implementation detail of the Rust compiler, but it's likely some kind of specialized iterator struct that represents the mapping operation.

To get a concrete collection from the b iterator, you need to consume it and collect the results into a data structure, like a Vec or a HashSet. That's what you're doing in the next line:

rust

Copy code
let c = b.collect();
This line consumes the b iterator and collects its elements into a Vec<(String, i32)>, which is then assigned to the c variable.

So, in summary, the map method doesn't produce a Map type; it produces a new iterator that yields transformed elements based on the provided closure. To get a concrete collection, you need to consume that iterator using methods like collect(), for_each(), or sum().

I clicked the .map method on IDE and I got :


Copy code
iterator.rs file

#[rustc_diagnostic_item = "IteratorMap"]
#[inline]
#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
#[rustc_do_not_const_check]
fn map<B, F>(self, f: F) -> Map<Self, F>
where
    Self: Sized,
    F: FnMut(Self::Item) -> B,
{
    Map::new(self, f)
}

Ah, you're right! My previous explanation was incomplete. When you look at the implementation of the map method in the Rust standard library, it does return a Map type.

The Map struct is an iterator adapter that applies a closure to each element of an underlying iterator. It's defined in the iterator.rs file of the Rust standard library, like this:

rust

Copy code
pub struct Map<I, F> {
    iter: I,
    f: F,
}
The Map struct has two fields:

iter: The underlying iterator that Map is adapting.
f: The closure (or function) that will be applied to each element of the underlying iterator.
When you call a.map(...), the map method constructs a new Map instance with the original iterator a and the provided closure. The Map struct implements the Iterator trait, so it's itself an iterator that yields the transformed elements produced by applying the closure to each element of the underlying iterator.

So, you're correct that the map method returns a Map type, which is an iterator adapter that wraps the original iterator and applies the provided closure to each element.

The Map struct is an implementation detail of the Rust standard library, and you don't typically interact with it directly. Instead, you work with the iterators produced by methods like map, filter, take, etc., and consume them using methods like collect, for_each, or sum.

Thank you for pointing this out! It's always good to double-check the actual implementation details in the Rust standard library.

What's this Map versus datatype Map (e.g. Hashmap)?

The Map struct you're seeing in the documentation is not the same as data structures like HashMap or BTreeMap. It's an iterator adapter provided by the Rust standard library.

In Rust, iterators are a fundamental concept that allow you to iterate over sequences of values. The standard library provides many iterator adapters that allow you to transform or filter iterators in various ways. The Map struct is one such iterator adapter.

When you call .map(closure) on an iterator, it returns a new Map iterator that applies the provided closure to each element of the original iterator. For example:

rust

Copy code
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
let doubled = numbers.iter().map(|x| x * 2);
// doubled is now an iterator of type Map<std::vec::Iter<i32>, ...>
The Map iterator adapter wraps the original iterator and applies the closure to each element as you iterate over it.

In contrast, data structures like HashMap and BTreeMap are collections that store key-value pairs. They are not iterators, but they do implement the Iterator trait so that you can iterate over their contents.

So, in summary:

Map is an iterator adapter that transforms elements of an iterator by applying a closure.
HashMap and BTreeMap are data structures for storing key-value pairs, not iterators themselves. However, you can iterate over their contents using the methods they provide that return iterators.
The standard library documentation shows the implementation details of the Map struct because it's part of the public API for working with iterators in Rust. However, as an end-user, you typically don't interact with the Map struct directly - you just call .map(...) on iterators and work with the resulting iterator.

Why Rust doesn't have Functor or Monad, for .map method?

Edit
Rust doesn't have built-in abstractions like Functor or Monad like Haskell and some other functional programming languages. This is primarily because:

Rust's Design Philosophy: Rust aims to provide low-level control over systems programming while still being expressive and safe. The design philosophy emphasizes zero-cost abstractions, where abstractions like iterators, closures, and traits shouldn't impose any runtime overhead compared to manual implementations. Introducing abstractions like Functors or Monads could potentially add overhead or complexity that goes against this philosophy.
Avoiding Language Extensions: Rust tries to avoid introducing language extensions or features that would significantly increase the complexity of the language and its implementation. Functors and Monads are powerful abstractions, but they require additional language support and type system extensions to be fully realized.
Iterators and Closures: In Rust, a lot of the functionality provided by Functors and Monads can be achieved using iterators and closures. The iterator trait and its adapters like map, filter, and flat_map provide a way to express functional transformations and compositions in a concise and efficient manner.
Traits and Type Classes: While Rust doesn't have built-in support for Functors or Monads, it is possible to define and implement these abstractions using traits and type classes. However, this approach has its limitations and might not be as expressive or ergonomic as in languages with dedicated support for these abstractions.
That being said, there have been discussions and experimental projects exploring ways to bring Functor-like or Monad-like abstractions to Rust. For example, the frunk and funky crates provide implementations of various functional programming abstractions, including Functor and Monad, using Rust's trait system.

While these abstractions are not part of the core language, they can be useful in certain contexts, especially when writing more functional-style code or when dealing with monadic computations like error handling or state management.

Ultimately, the decision not to include Functors or Monads as built-in language features in Rust reflects the language's design goals and trade-offs, favoring low-level control and performance over providing high-level functional abstractions out of the box.


The Map struct exists in the Rust standard library as an implementation detail for the `.map()` iterator adapter method. It serves a specific purpose in the iterator infrastructure, but it's not something that developers typically interact with directly.

Here are a few reasons why the Map struct is needed:

1. **Iterator Adapters**: In Rust, iterator adapters like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.flat_map()` are implemented by creating a new struct that wraps the original iterator and applies the desired transformation. This allows the adapter to be lazy and only perform the transformation when the iterator is actually consumed.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: By separating the transformation logic (the closure passed to `.map()`) from the iteration logic, the Map struct helps maintain a clear separation of concerns. The Map struct is responsible for applying the transformation, while the underlying iterator is responsible for providing the elements.

3. **Composability**: Iterator adapters in Rust are designed to be composable, meaning you can chain multiple adapters together. Having a separate struct for each adapter makes this composition possible and easier to reason about.

4. **Ownership and Borrowing**: The Map struct helps manage the ownership and borrowing of the underlying iterator and the closure used for transformation. It ensures that the closure and the iterator are properly captured and owned, avoiding any potential dangling references or ownership issues.

5. **Performance Optimization**: While not a primary concern, having a dedicated struct for the `.map()` adapter allows for potential optimizations in the future, such as specializing the implementation for different iterator types or applying other performance tricks specific to the mapping operation.

From a user's perspective, you don't need to worry about the Map struct directly. The Rust standard library provides a clean and ergonomic interface for working with iterators, and the existence of the Map struct is an implementation detail that allows the iterator infrastructure to function correctly and efficiently.

When you call `.map(closure)` on an iterator, you're creating a new iterator of type `Map<OriginalIterator, ClosureType>`, but you can treat it like any other iterator and continue chaining other adapter methods or consuming the iterator as needed.
