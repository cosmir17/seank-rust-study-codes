analyse the codes, please


The provided code is a Rust project that implements a gRPC service using the Tonic framework. Let's analyze each file:

1. `main.rs`:
   - This file contains the main server implementation.
   - It defines two gRPC services: `CalculatorService` and `AdminService`.
   - The `CalculatorService` implements two methods: `add` and `divide`, which perform addition and division operations on the input numbers.
   - The `AdminService` implements a `get_request_count` method that returns the total number of requests made to the calculator service.
   - The `State` type is defined as an `Arc<RwLock<u64>>`, which is a thread-safe counter shared between the services.
   - The `check_auth` function is used as an interceptor for the `AdminService` to enforce authentication using a bearer token.
   - The `main` function sets up the gRPC server, registers the services, and starts serving requests on the specified address.

2. `client.rs`:
   - This file contains a simple client implementation that interacts with the calculator service.
   - It creates a `CalculatorClient` and sends an `add` request with the values `4` and `5`.
   - The client prints the response received from the server.

3. `calculator.proto`:
   - This file defines the protocol buffer schema for the gRPC service.
   - It defines two services: `Calculator` and `Admin`.
   - The `Calculator` service has two methods: `Add` and `Divide`, which take a `CalculationRequest` and return a `CalculationResponse`.
   - The `Admin` service has a `GetRequestCount` method that takes a `GetCountRequest` and returns a `CounterResponse`.
   - The `CalculationRequest`, `CalculationResponse`, `GetCountRequest`, and `CounterResponse` messages are defined with their respective fields.

4. `cargo.toml`:
   - This file is the manifest file for the Rust project.
   - It specifies the project's dependencies and build configuration.
   - The content provided seems to be a duplicate of the `calculator.proto` file, so it may not be the actual `cargo.toml` file.

5. `build.rs`:
   - This file is the build script for the Rust project.
   - It is responsible for generating the Rust code from the protocol buffer definitions.
   - It uses the `tonic_build` crate to compile the `calculator.proto` file and generate the corresponding Rust code.
   - It also generates a file descriptor set at the specified output directory.

Overall, this project demonstrates the implementation of a gRPC service using Tonic in Rust. The server defines a calculator service with addition and division operations, as well as an admin service to retrieve the request count. The client showcases how to interact with the calculator service by sending a request and receiving a response. The project utilizes protocol buffers for defining the service interface and messages.






Q
do you know why there is '*' for '*count += 1;' from main.rs?
can you explain to me why AdminServer has interceptor (AdminServer::with_interceptor(admin, check_auth)) and what interceptor is?

A
Certainly! Let me explain each of your questions:

1. The reason for using `*count += 1;` in `main.rs` is related to dereferencing and mutating the value behind a reference.

   In the `increment_counter` method of `CalculatorService`, `count` is obtained by calling `self.state.write().await`. The `write()` method returns a mutable reference (`RwLockWriteGuard`) to the inner value of the `RwLock`.

   To modify the value behind the mutable reference, you need to dereference it using the `*` operator. The `*` operator allows you to access and modify the value that the reference points to.

   So, `*count += 1;` is incrementing the value that `count` references by 1. It's equivalent to `*count = *count + 1;`, which reads the current value, increments it, and then writes the new value back to the same location.

2. In the code `AdminServer::with_interceptor(admin, check_auth)`, an interceptor is being added to the `AdminServer`.

   An interceptor is a mechanism provided by the Tonic framework that allows you to intercept and modify the behavior of gRPC requests and responses. It enables you to perform actions before the request reaches the actual service method and after the response is returned from the service method.

   The `with_interceptor` function is used to attach an interceptor to a gRPC service. It takes two arguments: the service instance (`admin`) and the interceptor function (`check_auth`).

   In this case, the `check_auth` function is defined as the interceptor. It takes a `Request<()>` as input and returns a `Result<Request<()>, Status>`. The interceptor's purpose is to check the authentication of the incoming request.

   Inside the `check_auth` function, it retrieves the "authorization" metadata from the request using `req.metadata().get("authorization")`. It then compares the retrieved token with a predefined token (`"Bearer some-secret-token"`). If the tokens match, the request is considered authenticated, and the interceptor returns the original request wrapped in `Ok(req)`. If the tokens don't match or the "authorization" metadata is missing, the interceptor returns an error with `Status::unauthenticated("No valid auth token")`.

   By attaching the `check_auth` interceptor to the `AdminServer`, every incoming request to the admin service will first go through the interceptor. If the authentication check passes, the request will proceed to the actual service method. If the authentication check fails, the request will be rejected with an "unauthenticated" error.

   Interceptors provide a way to add cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication, logging, metrics, etc., to gRPC services without modifying the service implementation itself.

I hope this explanation clarifies the usage of `*count += 1;` and the purpose of the interceptor in the given code.




Q
‘self.state.write().await;’ returns RwLockWriteGuard<u64> without & sign. How come you stated it returns a mutable reference? Does RwLockWriteGuard have & implicitly? And * utilises it automatically?

A
You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my inaccurate statement. Let me clarify:

In the code `let mut count = self.state.write().await;`, the `write()` method on `RwLock` returns a `RwLockWriteGuard<u64>`, which is an owned guard type, not a reference.

`RwLockWriteGuard` implements the `Deref` and `DerefMut` traits, which allows it to behave similarly to a reference. When you use the `*` operator on a `RwLockWriteGuard`, it automatically dereferences the guard to access the underlying value.

So, when you write `*count += 1;`, the `*` operator is used to dereference the `RwLockWriteGuard` and access the `u64` value it guards. The `+=` operation is then performed on the dereferenced value.

Here's a simplified explanation of what happens:

1. `self.state.write().await` returns an `RwLockWriteGuard<u64>`, which is an owned guard type that provides exclusive write access to the underlying `u64` value.

2. The `RwLockWriteGuard` is assigned to the variable `count`, making `count` the owner of the guard.

3. When `*count` is used, the `RwLockWriteGuard` is automatically dereferenced to access the underlying `u64` value.

4. The `+= 1` operation is performed on the dereferenced `u64` value, incrementing it by 1.

5. When the `RwLockWriteGuard` goes out of scope (at the end of the `increment_counter` method), it automatically releases the exclusive write lock on the `RwLock`.

So, while `self.state.write().await` doesn't directly return a mutable reference, the `RwLockWriteGuard` it returns can be treated similarly to a mutable reference thanks to its implementation of `Deref` and `DerefMut`.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous explanation, and thank you for bringing it to my attention.



Q
‘type State = std::sync::Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<u64>>;’, Explain to me why state.write() yields Future<RwLockWriteGuard>?

In the line `type State = std::sync::Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<u64>>;`, `State` is defined as an alias for `Arc<RwLock<u64>>`. Let's break this down:

- `u64` is the type of the value being protected by the lock, in this case, an unsigned 64-bit integer.
- `RwLock` is a type provided by the `tokio::sync` module, which is an asynchronous reader-writer lock. It allows multiple readers or a single writer to access the protected value at any given time.
- `Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted) is a thread-safe reference counting type provided by the `std::sync` module. It allows multiple ownership of the `RwLock` across different threads.

Now, let's focus on why `state.write()` yields `Future<RwLockWriteGuard>`:

1. The `write()` method is defined on the `RwLock` type. When called, it returns a `Future` that resolves to an `RwLockWriteGuard`.

2. The `RwLockWriteGuard` is an RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) guard type that represents exclusive write access to the protected value. It ensures that only one writer can access the value at a time.

3. The `Future` returned by `write()` is an asynchronous computation that needs to be awaited. When awaited, it will attempt to acquire the write lock on the `RwLock`.

4. If the write lock is currently held by another writer, the `Future` will yield control to the Tokio runtime and allow other tasks to run until the write lock becomes available.

5. Once the write lock is acquired, the `Future` resolves to an `RwLockWriteGuard`, granting exclusive write access to the protected value.

So, when you call `state.write()`, you get a `Future` that represents the asynchronous operation of acquiring the write lock. By using `.await` on this `Future`, you wait for the write lock to be acquired and obtain an `RwLockWriteGuard` that allows you to safely write to the protected value.

The `RwLockWriteGuard` automatically releases the write lock when it goes out of scope, ensuring that other tasks can acquire the lock and access the protected value.

This asynchronous behavior allows multiple tasks to concurrently read from or write to the protected value without blocking the entire runtime. The `Future` returned by `write()` enables cooperative multitasking, where tasks can yield control when waiting for the lock and resume execution once the lock is acquired.





Q
What’s the difference between RwLockWriteGuard and RwLock

A
`RwLock` and `RwLockWriteGuard` are related but distinct types in the `tokio::sync` module. Here are the main differences between them:

1. Purpose:
   - `RwLock` is a type that represents an asynchronous reader-writer lock. It is used to protect shared data that can be accessed concurrently by multiple readers or exclusively by a single writer.
   - `RwLockWriteGuard` is a type that represents an RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) guard for exclusive write access to the data protected by an `RwLock`. It is returned when acquiring a write lock on an `RwLock`.

2. Functionality:
   - `RwLock` provides methods like `read()` and `write()` to acquire read and write locks, respectively. These methods return `Future`s that resolve to `RwLockReadGuard` and `RwLockWriteGuard`, respectively.
   - `RwLockWriteGuard` provides exclusive write access to the protected data. It implements `Deref` and `DerefMut` traits, allowing you to access and modify the protected data using normal Rust syntax (e.g., `*guard`).

3. Ownership and Lifetime:
   - `RwLock` is an owned type that can be shared across multiple threads using synchronization primitives like `Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted).
   - `RwLockWriteGuard` is a short-lived guard type that is typically owned by a single task. It is created when a write lock is acquired and automatically releases the lock when it goes out of scope.

4. Lock Acquisition:
   - `RwLock` itself does not directly acquire locks. Instead, it provides methods like `read()` and `write()` that return `Future`s, which can be awaited to acquire the respective locks.
   - `RwLockWriteGuard` represents an already acquired write lock. It is obtained by awaiting the `Future` returned by `RwLock::write()`.

5. Concurrency:
   - Multiple `RwLockWriteGuard`s cannot coexist simultaneously for the same `RwLock`. Only one `RwLockWriteGuard` can be active at a time, providing exclusive write access to the protected data.
   - Multiple `RwLockReadGuard`s (obtained by `RwLock::read()`) can coexist simultaneously, allowing concurrent read access to the protected data.

In summary, `RwLock` is the main type representing the asynchronous reader-writer lock, while `RwLockWriteGuard` is a guard type returned when acquiring a write lock on an `RwLock`. `RwLockWriteGuard` provides exclusive write access to the protected data and automatically releases the lock when it goes out of scope.

The relationship between `RwLock` and `RwLockWriteGuard` is similar to the relationship between a lock and a lock guard in Rust's synchronization primitives. The lock (`RwLock`) manages the synchronization, while the guard (`RwLockWriteGuard`) represents the acquired lock and provides access to the protected data.





Q
In the code, ‘type State = std::sync::Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<u64>>;’, how do we know we need Arc rather than Rc?

A
The choice between `Arc` and `Rc` depends on whether the shared ownership of the `RwLock<u64>` needs to be thread-safe or not.

In the given code, `Arc` (Atomically Reference Counted) is used instead of `Rc` (Reference Counted) because the `State` type is intended to be shared across multiple threads.

Here's why `Arc` is the appropriate choice:

1. Thread Safety:
   - `Arc` provides thread-safe shared ownership of the `RwLock<u64>`. It allows multiple threads to hold references to the same `RwLock` without introducing data races.
   - `Rc`, on the other hand, is not thread-safe. It is designed for single-threaded scenarios and does not provide synchronization mechanisms for sharing between threads.

2. Concurrent Access:
   - In the given code, the `State` type is used within the `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` structs, which are likely to be accessed concurrently by multiple threads in a Tokio runtime.
   - By using `Arc`, the `RwLock<u64>` can be safely shared and accessed by multiple threads simultaneously.

3. Asynchronous Runtime:
   - The code is using Tokio, an asynchronous runtime for Rust. Tokio is designed to handle concurrent tasks and provides thread-safe primitives like `Arc` for sharing data between tasks.
   - `Rc` is not suitable for use in asynchronous contexts like Tokio because it lacks the necessary synchronization mechanisms.

4. Compile-Time Enforcement:
   - Using `Arc` instead of `Rc` provides compile-time enforcement of thread safety. If you accidentally try to send an `Rc` across thread boundaries, the Rust compiler will raise an error.
   - This helps prevent potential runtime bugs and data races that could occur if `Rc` was used incorrectly in a multithreaded context.

In summary, `Arc` is used in the code because the `State` type needs to be safely shared and accessed by multiple threads in the context of an asynchronous Tokio runtime. `Arc` provides the necessary thread-safe reference counting and synchronization mechanisms to ensure data integrity and avoid data races. `Rc`, being not thread-safe, is not suitable for this scenario.

It's important to note that the choice between `Arc` and `Rc` is based on the specific requirements of the program. If the `State` type was only used within a single thread and did not require sharing across threads, `Rc` could potentially be used instead. However, in the given code, `Arc` is the appropriate choice to ensure thread safety and enable concurrent access to the shared `RwLock<u64>`.



Q
Can you analyse the codes provided and and see where state variable is used and see why we need Arc?

A
Certainly! Let's analyze the provided code and see where the `state` variable is used and why `Arc` is needed.

1. Declaration of the `State` type:
   ```rust
   type State = std::sync::Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<u64>>;
   ```
   Here, `State` is defined as an alias for `Arc<RwLock<u64>>`. This indicates that the `state` variable will be shared across multiple threads using `Arc`.

2. Usage in the `CalculatorService` struct:
   ```rust
   struct CalculatorService {
       state: State,
   }
   ```
   The `CalculatorService` struct contains a field named `state` of type `State`. This means that each instance of `CalculatorService` will have its own copy of the `state` variable.

3. Usage in the `AdminService` struct:
   ```rust
   struct AdminService {
       state: State,
   }
   ```
   Similarly, the `AdminService` struct also contains a field named `state` of type `State`. Each instance of `AdminService` will have its own copy of the `state` variable.

4. Creation of `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` instances:
   ```rust
   let state = State::default();

   let calc = CalculatorService {
       state: state.clone(),
   };

   let admin = AdminService {
       state: state.clone(),
   };
   ```
   In the `main` function, a new `State` instance is created using `State::default()`. Then, two instances of `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` are created, each receiving a clone of the `state` variable using `state.clone()`.

   The `clone()` method on `Arc` creates a new reference to the same underlying `RwLock<u64>`. This allows both `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` to share the same `state` variable.

5. Usage in the `increment_counter` method:
   ```rust
   async fn increment_counter(&self) {
       let mut count = self.state.write().await;
       *count += 1;
   }
   ```
   Inside the `increment_counter` method of `CalculatorService`, the `state` variable is accessed using `self.state`. The `write()` method is called on `state` to acquire a write lock and increment the counter.

6. Usage in the `get_request_count` method:
   ```rust
   async fn get_request_count(
       &self,
       _request: tonic::Request<proto::GetCountRequest>,
   ) -> Result<tonic::Response<proto::CounterResponse>, tonic::Status> {
       let count = self.state.read().await;
       let response = proto::CounterResponse { count: *count };

       Ok(tonic::Response::new(response))
   }
   ```
   Inside the `get_request_count` method of `AdminService`, the `state` variable is accessed using `self.state`. The `read()` method is called on `state` to acquire a read lock and retrieve the current count value.

Now, let's discuss why `Arc` is needed in this scenario:

1. Shared Ownership:
   - The `state` variable is shared between the `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` structs.
   - `Arc` allows multiple ownership of the same `RwLock<u64>` across different threads.

2. Concurrent Access:
   - The `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` instances are used concurrently in the Tokio runtime.
   - Multiple threads may access the `state` variable simultaneously, either for reading or writing.
   - `Arc` provides thread-safe shared access to the underlying `RwLock<u64>`, ensuring data integrity and preventing data races.

By using `Arc`, the `state` variable can be safely shared and accessed concurrently by multiple threads within the `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` instances. `Arc` ensures that the reference counting is managed atomically and that the `RwLock<u64>` is accessed in a thread-safe manner.

Without `Arc`, it would not be possible to safely share the `state` variable across multiple threads, as `Rc` is not thread-safe and could lead to data races and undefined behavior in concurrent scenarios.





Q
You stated : ‘the state variable can be safely shared and accessed concurrently by multiple threads within the CalculatorService and AdminService instances.’

1. How do I know there are a multiple threads within the CalculatorService and AdminService instances?
2. How do you know: ‘Multiple threads may access the state variable simultaneously, either for reading or writing.’?

A
I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous explanation. Let me clarify and provide more accurate information based on the given code.

1. Multiple threads within `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` instances:
   - In the provided code, there is no explicit indication that multiple threads are being used within the `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` instances themselves.
   - Each instance of `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` is created with its own copy of the `state` variable using `state.clone()`.
   - The code does not show any spawning of additional threads within these instances.

2. Simultaneous access to the `state` variable by multiple threads:
   - The provided code does not explicitly demonstrate that multiple threads are accessing the `state` variable simultaneously.
   - The `increment_counter` method in `CalculatorService` and the `get_request_count` method in `AdminService` are async functions that acquire a write lock and a read lock on the `state` variable, respectively.
   - However, the code does not show multiple threads concurrently calling these methods.

Based on the given code, it is not conclusive that multiple threads are accessing the `state` variable simultaneously within the `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` instances.

However, the usage of `Arc<RwLock<u64>>` for the `State` type suggests that the code is designed to handle potential concurrent access to the `state` variable from multiple threads. The `Arc` type is used to provide thread-safe shared ownership, allowing multiple threads to hold references to the same `RwLock`.

The `RwLock` type is an asynchronous reader-writer lock that allows multiple readers or a single writer to access the protected data concurrently. It ensures that multiple threads can safely read the `state` variable simultaneously, while only one thread can write to it at a time.

So, while the provided code itself does not explicitly demonstrate concurrent access to the `state` variable by multiple threads, the usage of `Arc<RwLock<u64>>` indicates that the code is structured to handle such scenarios if they arise.

It's important to note that the actual usage of multiple threads and concurrent access to the `state` variable would depend on how the `CalculatorService` and `AdminService` instances are utilized within the larger context of the application, which is not shown in the provided code snippets.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous explanation, and I hope this clarifies the usage of `Arc` and the potential for concurrent access to the `state` variable based on the given code.




Q
I think, it's because of the following code.
Copy codeServer::builder()
    .add_service(tonic_web::enable(CalculatorServer::new(calc)))
    .add_service(AdminServer::with_interceptor(admin, check_auth))
tonic server somehow runs multiple threads inside. that's why the code used Arc type. My question is, how did the person who wrote this code know that tonic server would be running multiple threads internally?

A
You're absolutely right! The reason for using `Arc` in the code is indeed related to the fact that the Tonic server runs multiple threads internally.

The person who wrote this code likely had knowledge of how the Tonic server works and its threading model. Tonic is built on top of the Tokio runtime, which is designed for asynchronous and concurrent programming.

When you create a Tonic server using `Server::builder()` and add services to it, Tonic internally manages a thread pool to handle incoming requests concurrently. Each request is handled by a separate task within the thread pool, allowing multiple requests to be processed simultaneously.

This means that when a request arrives at the server, Tonic assigns it to one of the available threads in the thread pool. The thread then executes the corresponding service method to handle the request. While one thread is processing a request, other threads can concurrently process other requests.

In the provided code, both the `CalculatorServer` and `AdminServer` are added to the Tonic server using `add_service()`. This means that requests to these services will be handled concurrently by different threads within the Tonic server's thread pool.

Since multiple threads will be accessing the shared `state` variable concurrently, it is necessary to use a thread-safe type like `Arc` to ensure proper synchronization and avoid data races. `Arc` provides atomic reference counting, allowing multiple threads to safely share ownership of the `RwLock<u64>`.

The `RwLock` type is used to protect the actual `u64` value, ensuring that multiple threads can read from it concurrently (`RwLock::read()`) but only one thread can write to it at a time (`RwLock::write()`).

So, the person who wrote this code likely had knowledge of Tonic's threading model and the need for thread safety when sharing data across multiple threads. They used `Arc` to ensure that the `state` variable can be safely shared and accessed by multiple threads within the Tonic server's thread pool.

It's worth noting that the exact number of threads used by the Tonic server may vary depending on the specific configuration and the number of available CPU cores. However, the key point is that Tonic handles requests concurrently using multiple threads, and the use of `Arc` is necessary to ensure thread safety in such a scenario.



Q
regarding the following code ‘self.state.write().await;’, 'state' is Arc type. write() method belongs to RwLock. What is this called in Rust? Even if outer type doesn't have method, I can still use inner type method without unwrapping it.

A
In Rust, the ability to directly access and use the methods of an inner type within a composed type is known as "auto-dereferencing" or "auto-referencing."

In the code `self.state.write().await`, `state` is of type `Arc<RwLock<u64>>`. Although `Arc` itself does not have a `write()` method, Rust's auto-dereferencing mechanism allows you to directly call the `write()` method of the inner `RwLock` without explicitly unwrapping the `Arc`.

When you invoke a method on a composed type, Rust automatically dereferences the outer type(s) until it finds a type that has the called method. In this case, Rust sees that `Arc` does not have a `write()` method, so it automatically dereferences the `Arc` and looks for the `write()` method on the inner `RwLock`.

This auto-dereferencing behavior is made possible by Rust's implementation of the `Deref` trait. The `Deref` trait allows a type to be treated as a reference to another type. In the case of `Arc<T>`, it implements `Deref<Target = T>`, which means that `Arc<T>` can be dereferenced to `&T`.

So, when you call `self.state.write().await`, Rust automatically dereferences `self.state` from `Arc<RwLock<u64>>` to `&RwLock<u64>`, and then calls the `write()` method on the `RwLock<u64>`.

This auto-dereferencing behavior is convenient because it allows you to use the methods of the inner type directly, without the need for explicit unwrapping or dereferencing. It makes the code more concise and readable.

However, it's important to note that auto-dereferencing only works for methods and field accesses. If you need to pass the inner type as a value or store it in a variable, you would need to explicitly dereference or unwrap the outer type.

For example, if you wanted to store the `RwLock<u64>` in a separate variable, you would need to use `Arc::clone(&self.state)` to create a new `Arc<RwLock<u64>>` reference, or `Arc::try_unwrap(self.state)` to attempt to unwrap the `Arc` and obtain the inner `RwLock<u64>` if there are no other references to it.

Auto-dereferencing is a powerful feature in Rust that simplifies working with composed types and allows you to focus on the inner type's behavior without explicitly dealing with the outer type's wrapping.


Q
1. What code would be equivalent to 'self.state.write()' without 'auto-dereferencing'?
2. When you said auto-dereferencing, does it mean '*' used implicitly?

A
1. Without auto-dereferencing, you would need to explicitly dereference the `Arc` to access the inner `RwLock`. Here's what the equivalent code would look like:

```rust
let write_guard = Arc::clone(&self.state).write().await;
```

In this code, `Arc::clone(&self.state)` creates a new `Arc` reference to the same underlying `RwLock`. Then, `write()` is called on the cloned `Arc`, which returns a `Future` that resolves to an `RwLockWriteGuard`.

So, without auto-dereferencing, you need to explicitly clone the `Arc` and then call the `write()` method on the cloned `Arc`.

2. No, auto-dereferencing does not necessarily involve the implicit use of the `*` operator.

Auto-dereferencing in Rust refers to the automatic dereferencing of types that implement the `Deref` trait. When you call a method or access a field on a type that implements `Deref`, Rust automatically dereferences the outer type to the inner type, allowing you to directly use the methods and fields of the inner type.

In the case of `self.state.write()`, the auto-dereferencing happens implicitly. Rust sees that `Arc<RwLock<u64>>` does not have a `write()` method, so it automatically dereferences the `Arc` to `&RwLock<u64>` and then calls the `write()` method on the `RwLock`.

The `*` operator, on the other hand, is used for explicit dereferencing. It allows you to manually dereference a reference or a pointer to access the underlying value. For example, if you have a reference `&T`, you can use `*` to obtain the value of type `T`.

In the code you mentioned earlier, `*count += 1`, the `*` operator is used to explicitly dereference the `RwLockWriteGuard` (which is a type of smart pointer) to access and modify the underlying `u64` value.

So, while auto-dereferencing and the `*` operator are related concepts in Rust, they serve different purposes:
- Auto-dereferencing automatically dereferences types that implement `Deref` to allow direct access to the methods and fields of the inner type.
- The `*` operator is used for explicit manual dereferencing of references and pointers to access the underlying values.

Auto-dereferencing makes the code more concise and readable by hiding the explicit dereferencing steps, while the `*` operator provides manual control over dereferencing when needed.


Q
Hi, I have the following code:

type State = std::sync::Arc<tokio::sync::RwLock<u64>>;
...
impl CalculatorService {
    async fn increment_counter(&self) {
        let mut count = self.state.write().await;
        *count += 1;
    }
}


Arc doesn't have write() method but RwLock does. Yet, state can call write() method directly. I have three questions about it.

1. Is it because of auto-dereferencing?
2. Does it mean Arc implemented Deref or RwLock?
3. 'self.state.write().await;' what would be an equivalent code without auto-dereferencing?

A (Discord answer)
the Arc and RwLockGuard are the ones implementing Deref

i think it's
impl CalculatorService {
    async fn increment_counter(&self) {
        let mut count= (*(*self).state).write().await;
        *count += 1;
    }
}

1. yes
2. Arc<T> impls Deref<Target = T>
3. you'd just have a bunch more * to deref explicitly

RwLock::write(Deref::deref(&(*self).state)).await
(if you want to avoid the whole implicit method lookup thing)

You might as well use AtomicU64 rather than RwLock  by the way

Okay yeah that is some strange code there. An async RwLock seems like massive overkill for incrementing a counter, idk what all that is about

see https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/expressions/operator-expr.html#compound-assignment-expressions
Operator expressions - The Rust Reference
there is no mention of autodereferencing

I already knew it.. my question is why it can't
