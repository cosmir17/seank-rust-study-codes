what is the following type in Rust?


Copy code
&[i32]
In Rust, &[i32] represents a borrowed slice of i32 values.

A slice is a dynamically-sized view into a contiguous sequence of elements in memory. It consists of a pointer to the first element and the length of the slice.

In this specific case:

i32 is the element type, representing a 32-bit signed integer.
& denotes that it is a reference, meaning it borrows the slice rather than owning it.
So, &[i32] is a borrowed slice of i32 elements. The slice itself is not owned by the current scope but is instead borrowed from somewhere else.

Slices are often used when you want to pass a portion of an array or vector to a function without transferring ownership. They provide a safe and efficient way to reference contiguous elements in memory without copying the data.

Here's an example of using a slice:

rust


Copy code
fn sum(values: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    values.iter().sum()
}

fn main() {
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let result = sum(&numbers);
    println!("Sum: {}", result);
}
In this example, the sum function takes a borrowed slice of i32 values and computes their sum using the iter().sum() method. The &numbers syntax creates a slice that borrows the entire numbers array.
