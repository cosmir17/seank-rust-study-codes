call str as string slice? and call &str

rust programming, Why don't they call str as string slice? and call &str


In Rust, the term "string slice" is not used to refer to `str`. Instead, `str` is called a "string slice" or a "string view", while `&str` is called a "string slice reference" or a "borrowed string slice".

The reason for this naming convention is that `str` itself is not a type but rather a primitive string slice type. It represents a view into a string's data, similar to how slices work for arrays. The `&str` type is a reference to a `str`, which allows it to be passed around and borrowed without taking ownership of the underlying string data.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

1. `str`: This is a primitive type in Rust that represents a string slice, which is a view into the contents of a string. It is an unsized type, meaning it doesn't have a fixed size at compile-time, and it cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it is used as a component in other types or as a pattern in match statements.

2. `&str`: This is a reference to a `str`. It is a sized type that can be instantiated and passed around as a value. When you have a `&str`, you have a borrowed view into a string's data, which means you can read from it, but you cannot modify it directly.

The reason why `str` is not called a "string slice" is that it is already a string slice type, and the term "slice" is more commonly used with arrays and vectors in Rust. Instead, the terminology "string view" or "string slice" is used to describe `str`, as it provides a view into a string's data without owning it.

On the other hand, `&str` is called a "string slice reference" or a "borrowed string slice" because it is a reference to a `str`, which allows borrowing or accessing the string data without taking ownership of it.

This naming convention helps distinguish between the two types and their respective roles in Rust's string handling. `str` represents the actual string slice data, while `&str` is a reference that borrows that data, allowing for safe and efficient string manipulation without duplicating or moving the underlying data unnecessarily.

give me examples of str type

In Rust, the `str` type is a primitive type that represents a string slice, which is a view into some string data. Since `str` is an unsized type, it cannot be instantiated directly, but it is used as a component in other types or as a pattern in match statements.

Here are some examples of how `str` can be used:

1. **As a pattern in match statements**:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello";
    match s {
        "hello" => println!("It's hello!"),
        "world" => println!("It's world!"),
        _ => println!("It's something else"),
    }
}
```

2. **As a component in other types**:

- `String`: The `String` type in Rust is a growable, UTF-8 encoded string type that owns its data. The `as_str()` method returns an `&str` that references the string data.

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let s_str: &str = s.as_str();
```

- `&str`: The `&str` type is a reference to a `str`, allowing you to borrow the string data without taking ownership.

```rust
let s = "hello";
let s_str: &str = s;
```

3. **As a function parameter**:

Functions can take `&str` as a parameter to accept string slices.

```rust
fn greet(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {}!", name);
}

fn main() {
    let name = "Alice";
    greet(name);
}
```

4. **In pattern matching**:

You can use `str` patterns in match statements to match against string slices.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "hello world";
    match s {
        "hello" => println!("It's hello!"),
        "world" => println!("It's world!"),
        _ => println!("It's something else"),
    }
}
```

5. **With methods**:

Some methods in the Rust standard library operate on `str` and return `&str` or take `&str` as arguments.

```rust
let s = "hello";
let len = s.len(); // Returns the length of the string slice
let starts_with_h = s.starts_with("h"); // Checks if the string slice starts with "h"
```

While you cannot create an instance of `str` directly, you can work with string slices through `&str` references or by using methods that return `&str` values from other types like `String`.

Rust why string slice is called a string slice? They are just a reference?


In Rust, a string slice, denoted as `&str`, is called a "string slice" because it represents a reference to a portion (or slice) of a string. It's important to understand that a string slice is not the same as a `String` type in Rust.

Here are a few key points about string slices:

1. A string slice is a reference to a sequence of bytes that are guaranteed to be valid UTF-8. It provides a view into a portion of a string without owning the underlying data.

2. A string slice can refer to a part or the entire contents of a `String`, a string literal, or any other source of string data.

3. Since a string slice is a reference, it borrows the data it refers to and does not have ownership of the data. This means that the lifetime of a string slice is tied to the lifetime of the data it refers to.

4. String slices are immutable by default. If you have a mutable reference to a `String`, you can obtain a mutable string slice using the `&mut str` syntax.

5. String slices are often used as function parameters or return types when you don't need ownership of the string data and want to avoid the overhead of copying the entire string.

Here's an example to illustrate the concept of a string slice:

```rust
let s = String::from("Hello, world!");
let hello: &str = &s[0..5];
println!("{}", hello); // Output: "Hello"
```

In this example, `hello` is a string slice that refers to a portion of the `String` `s`. It represents the characters from index 0 to 5 (exclusive) of the original string.

So, while a string slice is a reference, it specifically refers to a slice of a string. The term "string slice" emphasizes that it is a view into a portion of a string, rather than being a standalone string type like `String`.
