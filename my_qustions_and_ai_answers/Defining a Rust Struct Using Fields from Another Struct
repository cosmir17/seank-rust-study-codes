Based on the conversation, it seems you are asking about defining a struct in Rust by using the fields from another struct, like this:

rust


Copy code
struct Foo {
  ..Baz,
  more: String
}
Unfortunately, this syntax is not supported in Rust for defining structs. Rust does not have direct mechanisms for inheritance or spreading fields from one struct into another when defining a struct.

To achieve something similar, you have a couple options:

Include the other struct as a field in the new struct:
rust


Copy code
struct Baz {
  // fields
}

struct Foo {
  baz: Baz,
  more: String,
}
Duplicate the fields from the other struct in the new struct:
rust


Copy code
struct Baz {
  field1: String,
  field2: i32,
}

struct Foo {
  field1: String,
  field2: i32,
  more: String,
}
If the additional fields are optional, consider just adding them to the original struct and using Option:
rust


Copy code
struct Baz {
  // original fields
  more: Option<String>,
}
So in summary, Rust doesn't support spreading fields from one struct to another using .. syntax when defining structs. The common approaches are to either include the other struct as a field, duplicate the fields, or add optional fields to the original struct if appropriate.
