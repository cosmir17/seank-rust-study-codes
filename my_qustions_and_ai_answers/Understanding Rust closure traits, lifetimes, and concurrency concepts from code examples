I have the following Rust code :


Copy code
pub fn spawn_blocking_with_tracing<F, R>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<R>
where
    F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static,
    R: Send + 'static,
{
    let current_span = tracing::Span::current();
    actix_web::rt::task::spawn_blocking(move || current_span.in_scope(f))
}
Tell me about, FnOnce, 'static and '+'?

Certainly! Let's go through each of the concepts you mentioned:

FnOnce:
FnOnce is a trait in Rust that represents a closure that can be called once.
It is the most general of the three closure traits (Fn, FnMut, and FnOnce).
A closure that implements FnOnce can capture variables from its environment by move, meaning it takes ownership of those variables.
After an FnOnce closure is called, it consumes the captured variables, and they are no longer available for subsequent calls.
In the given code, F: FnOnce() -> R specifies that the generic type F is a closure that takes no arguments, returns a value of type R, and can be called once.
'static:
'static is a lifetime annotation in Rust that indicates that a reference or value can live for the entire duration of the program.
It is the longest possible lifetime in Rust.
When used as a constraint on a generic type, such as R: Send + 'static, it means that the type R must not contain any non-static references (i.e., references with lifetimes shorter than 'static).
In the given code, R: Send + 'static specifies that the return type R of the closure must be Send (able to be safely sent between threads) and have a 'static lifetime.
+:
In the context of trait bounds, + is used to specify multiple trait constraints on a generic type.
It allows you to require that a type implements multiple traits.
In the given code, F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static means that the generic type F must implement the FnOnce trait (as described above) and also implement the Send trait (indicating it can be safely sent between threads) and have a 'static lifetime.
Similarly, R: Send + 'static means that the generic type R must implement the Send trait and have a 'static lifetime.
The spawn_blocking_with_tracing function takes a closure f of type F that captures the current tracing span (current_span). It then spawns a blocking task using actix_web::rt::task::spawn_blocking and moves the closure and captured span into the task. Inside the task, the closure is executed within the context of the captured span using current_span.in_scope(f), allowing the tracing information to be propagated to the spawned task.

The trait bounds on F and R ensure that the closure and its return type are suitable for being sent between threads and do not contain any non-static references.

I have the following Rust code :


Copy code
pub fn spawn_blocking_with_tracing<F, R>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<R>
where
    F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static,
    R: Send + 'static,
{
    let current_span = tracing::Span::current();
    actix_web::rt::task::spawn_blocking(move || current_span.in_scope(f))
}
Explain to me what FnOnce, 'static and '+' do

Certainly! Let's break down the role of FnOnce, 'static, and + in the given Rust code:

FnOnce:
FnOnce is a trait in Rust that represents a closure that can be called once.
It allows the closure to capture variables from its environment by move, meaning it takes ownership of those variables.
Once an FnOnce closure is called, the captured variables are consumed and no longer available for subsequent calls.
In the code F: FnOnce() -> R, it specifies that the generic type F is a closure that takes no arguments, returns a value of type R, and can be called once.
'static:
'static is a lifetime annotation in Rust that indicates a reference or value can live for the entire duration of the program.
It is the longest possible lifetime in Rust.
When used as a constraint on a generic type, such as F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static, it means that the closure F and its captured variables must have a 'static lifetime.
Similarly, R: Send + 'static means that the return type R must also have a 'static lifetime.
This ensures that the closure and its return value can be safely sent between threads and do not contain any references with shorter lifetimes.
+:
In the context of trait bounds, + is used to specify multiple trait constraints on a generic type.
It allows you to require that a type implements multiple traits.
In the code F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static, the + is used to combine the FnOnce, Send, and 'static constraints on the generic type F.
It means that F must be a closure that implements FnOnce, is Send (can be safely sent between threads), and has a 'static lifetime.
Similarly, R: Send + 'static means that the return type R must implement the Send trait and have a 'static lifetime.
In summary, the spawn_blocking_with_tracing function takes a closure f of type F that captures the current tracing span. The FnOnce trait allows the closure to be called once and take ownership of the captured variables. The Send trait ensures that the closure and its return type can be safely sent between threads. The 'static lifetime constraint guarantees that the closure and its return type do not contain any references with shorter lifetimes.

Inside the function, the closure and the captured span are moved into a new blocking task spawned by actix_web::rt::task::spawn_blocking. The closure is then executed within the context of the captured span using current_span.in_scope(f), allowing the tracing information to be propagated to the spawned task.

'static is not a trait, how can it be combined with other type signatures?

You're absolutely right! I apologize for my imprecise wording. 'static is not a trait but a lifetime annotation. Let me clarify how it works in the context of the type signatures.

In Rust, lifetime annotations are used to specify the lifetime relationships between references. The 'static lifetime is a special lifetime that indicates a reference can live for the entire duration of the program.

When 'static is used as a constraint on a generic type, such as F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static, it doesn't mean that F implements the 'static trait (since 'static is not a trait). Instead, it means that the closure F and the values it captures have a 'static lifetime. In other words, the closure and its captured variables must outlive the entire program execution.

Similarly, R: Send + 'static means that the return type R must implement the Send trait and have a 'static lifetime. This ensures that the return value can be safely sent between threads and does not contain any references with shorter lifetimes.

The + in F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static is used to combine the trait bound FnOnce() -> R with the additional constraints Send and 'static. It specifies that F must be a closure that takes no arguments, returns a value of type R, is Send, and has a 'static lifetime.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous explanation. Thank you for pointing out the distinction between traits and lifetime annotations!

Previously, you said :

'static is a lifetime annotation in Rust that indicates a reference or value can live for the entire duration of the program.
What do you mean by 'the entire duration of the program'? is it like Java's static keyword?

I apologize for any confusion. The 'static lifetime in Rust is not the same as the static keyword in Java, although they share some similarities.

In Rust, 'static is a lifetime annotation that indicates a reference or value can live for the entire duration of the program execution. It doesn't mean that the value is necessarily allocated in a global or static memory area.

Here are a few key points about 'static in Rust:

'static references: When a reference has a 'static lifetime, it means that the reference is valid for the entire lifetime of the program. This implies that the referenced value will not be dropped or deallocated during the program's execution.
'static values: When a value has a 'static lifetime, it means that the value itself can live for the entire duration of the program. This is often the case for constants, string literals, and other immutable data that is embedded in the program's binary.
Not the same as global variables: In Rust, 'static does not necessarily mean that a value is a global variable. Rust has a separate concept of global variables, which are declared using the static keyword. Global variables in Rust have a 'static lifetime, but not all 'static values are global variables.
Thread safety: 'static values and references are not inherently thread-safe. They can be safely shared between threads only if they are immutable or if they implement proper synchronization mechanisms.
In contrast, the static keyword in Java is used to define class-level variables and methods. Static members belong to the class itself rather than instances of the class. They are allocated in a special memory area and have a lifetime that spans the entire program execution.

While both 'static in Rust and static in Java are related to the lifetime of the program, they serve different purposes and have different semantics in their respective languages.

I hope this clarifies the difference between 'static in Rust and static in Java. Let me know if you have any further questions!

In this code :

pub fn spawn_blocking_with_tracing<F, R>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<R> where F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static, R: Send + 'static, { let current_span = tracing::Span::current(); actix_web::rt::task::spawn_blocking(move || current_span.in_scope(f)) }

what kind of variable would have 'static lifetime?

In the given code:

rust


Copy code
pub fn spawn_blocking_with_tracing<F, R>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<R>
where
    F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static,
    R: Send + 'static,
{
    let current_span = tracing::Span::current();
    actix_web::rt::task::spawn_blocking(move || current_span.in_scope(f))
}
The 'static lifetime is used as a constraint on the generic types F and R. Let's examine each case:

F: FnOnce() -> R + Send + 'static:
This constraint specifies that the closure F and the values it captures must have a 'static lifetime.
It means that the closure F and its captured variables must be valid for the entire duration of the program.
In this case, the 'static lifetime applies to the closure itself and the variables it captures.
For example, if F captures a reference to a variable, that reference must have a 'static lifetime, ensuring that the referenced value will not be dropped or deallocated during the program's execution.
R: Send + 'static:
This constraint specifies that the return type R of the closure must have a 'static lifetime.
It means that the value returned by the closure must be valid for the entire duration of the program.
The 'static lifetime ensures that the returned value does not contain any references with shorter lifetimes.
For example, if R is a type that contains references, those references must have a 'static lifetime to satisfy this constraint.
In the context of this code, the 'static lifetime constraints are used to ensure that the closure F, its captured variables, and the return value R can be safely sent between threads and are valid for the entire duration of the program.

It's important to note that the 'static lifetime does not necessarily mean that the values are global or static variables. It simply indicates that they can live for the entire duration of the program and do not depend on any shorter-lived references.

The exact variables that would have a 'static lifetime depend on the specific closure F and the return type R used when calling the spawn_blocking_with_tracing function. The 'static constraints ensure that the closure and its return value meet the necessary lifetime requirements for being used in a spawned blocking task.

I was not asking for explanation, I was asking for example of F and R

Apologies for the misunderstanding. Let me provide you with an example of F and R that would satisfy the 'static lifetime constraint in the given code.

Example 1:

rust


Copy code
let data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let handle = spawn_blocking_with_tracing(move || {
    let sum = data.iter().sum::<i32>();
    sum
});
In this example:

F is a closure that captures data by move, which is a Vec<i32>. Since data is owned by the closure and does not contain any references, it satisfies the 'static lifetime constraint.
R is i32, which is a simple primitive type and does not contain any references. It also satisfies the 'static lifetime constraint.
Example 2:

rust


Copy code
let config = Arc::new(Config::new());

let handle = spawn_blocking_with_tracing(move || {
    let result = process_data(config.clone());
    result
});
In this example:

F is a closure that captures config, which is an Arc<Config>. Arc is a thread-safe reference-counting pointer that allows shared ownership. Since Arc itself has a 'static lifetime and the Config type is assumed to have a 'static lifetime, the closure satisfies the 'static lifetime constraint.
R is the return type of the process_data function. If result has a 'static lifetime (e.g., it doesn't contain any references with shorter lifetimes), it satisfies the 'static lifetime constraint.
These are just a couple of examples to illustrate the types that could be used for F and R while satisfying the 'static lifetime constraint. The actual types and values used depend on the specific use case and the requirements of the spawn_blocking_with_tracing function in the context of your program.

neither sum nor result have the static lifetime annotation, how come they satisfy the function types?

You're correct that sum and result do not have explicit 'static lifetime annotations in the examples I provided. However, they still satisfy the 'static lifetime constraint in the function types. Let me explain why.

In Rust, the 'static lifetime is automatically inferred for certain types that do not contain any references or have references that themselves have a 'static lifetime. This is known as "static promotion."

In the first example:

rust


Copy code
let handle = spawn_blocking_with_tracing(move || {
    let sum = data.iter().sum::<i32>();
    sum
});
sum is of type i32, which is a primitive type and does not contain any references. Primitive types have an implicit 'static lifetime because they are not tied to any specific lifetime or scope.
Therefore, sum satisfies the R: Send + 'static constraint because i32 is Send and has a 'static lifetime.
In the second example:

rust


Copy code
let handle = spawn_blocking_with_tracing(move || {
    let result = process_data(config.clone());
    result
});
result is the return value of the process_data function. Its type and lifetime depend on the implementation of process_data.
If process_data returns a value that does not contain any references or only contains references with 'static lifetimes, then result will also have a 'static lifetime.
For example, if process_data returns an owned value like a String, a primitive type, or a type that only contains owned values or 'static references, then result will satisfy the R: Send + 'static constraint.
In both cases, the 'static lifetime is implicitly satisfied because the types involved (i32 and the return type of process_data) do not have any lifetime constraints that would prevent them from being 'static.

It's important to note that if process_data returns a value that contains references with lifetimes shorter than 'static, or if it returns a reference to a value that is not 'static, then result would not satisfy the 'static lifetime constraint, and you would get a compilation error.

The Rust compiler's static analysis and lifetime inference ensure that the 'static constraint is satisfied based on the types and lifetimes involved, even if the 'static annotation is not explicitly written.

I am from Scala 3 background and I normally used 'val' rather than 'var'. I rarely use 'var'. How come 'mut' is used so frequently in Rust? Is it not hard to keep track of where their values are modified? Is it not simpler not to use 'mut' at all?

In Rust, variables are immutable by default, which means their values cannot be changed once assigned. This is similar to using val in Scala. To make a variable mutable, you need to explicitly declare it as mutable using the mut keyword.

The frequent use of mut in Rust has to do with the language's design principles and ownership system. Rust encourages you to be explicit about mutability to make it clear when a variable's value can be modified. This helps in reasoning about the code and prevents unintended modifications.

However, it's important to note that the use of mut does not necessarily mean that the variable is modified frequently or in multiple places. In many cases, mut is used to allow a single modification to a variable's value, after which it remains constant.

In the code snippet you provided, mut is used in two places:

let mut user_id = None;: Here, user_id is initially assigned None, but it might be modified later in the code to hold the actual user ID if the credentials are valid. The mut keyword allows this potential modification.
let mut expected_password_hash = ...;: Similarly, expected_password_hash is initially assigned a default value, but it might be updated with the stored password hash if the credentials are found in the database.
Using mut in these cases allows for the flexibility to modify the variables' values based on certain conditions. It does not necessarily mean that the values are constantly changing.

Regarding your question about the simplicity of not using mut at all, while it might seem simpler to make everything immutable, it can actually make the code more complex and less efficient in certain situations. Sometimes, you need to modify values to perform certain operations or update state. If you don't use mut, you would need to create new variables every time you want to modify a value, which can lead to more verbose and less readable code.

Rust's approach of using mut explicitly strikes a balance between the benefits of immutability and the practical need for mutability in certain cases. It encourages you to be intentional about mutability and makes it clear when a variable's value can be modified.

In Scala, you have the option to use var for mutable variables, but the language's focus on functional programming and immutability often leads to a preference for using val. However, Scala's type system and language features, such as case classes and immutable collections, make it easier to work with immutable data structures.

In Rust, the ownership system and the emphasis on system-level programming make mutability more prevalent and necessary in certain scenarios. Rust's type system and borrow checker ensure that mutable references are used safely and prevent common issues like data races and null pointer dereferences.

Ultimately, the choice between using mut or not depends on the specific requirements of your program and the trade-offs you are willing to make between simplicity, performance, and explicitness.
