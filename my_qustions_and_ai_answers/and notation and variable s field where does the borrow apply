I have the following Rust code :

#[tokio::test]
async fn subscribe_fails_if_there_is_a_fatal_database_error() {
    // Arrange
    let app = spawn_app().await;
    let body = "name=le%20guin&email=ursula_le_guin%40gmail.com";
    // Sabotage the database
    sqlx::query!("ALTER TABLE subscriptions DROP COLUMN email;",)
        .execute(&app.db_pool)
        .await
        .unwrap();

    // Act
    let response = app.post_subscriptions(body.into()).await;

    // Assert
    assert_eq!(response.status().as_u16(), 500);
}

I have a questions.

    '.execute(&app.db_pool)', does & apply to app or db_pool?

In the line .execute(&app.db_pool), the & applies to app.db_pool, not to app.

In Rust, & is used to create a reference to a value. In this case, app.db_pool is being passed as a reference to the execute method.

The reason for using & here is likely because the execute method expects a reference to a database connection pool (&Pool). By passing &app.db_pool, you are providing a reference to the db_pool field of the app instance.

So, to clarify:

    app.db_pool accesses the db_pool field of the app instance.
    &app.db_pool creates a reference to the db_pool field, allowing it to be passed as an argument to the execute method.

The & is not applied to app itself in this case.
