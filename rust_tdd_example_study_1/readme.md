### 5. `rust_tdd_example_study_1`

This module delves into the world of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Rust, showcasing various examples of writing unit tests, utilizing assertions, and mocking dependencies with the help of the `mockall` crate.

The module consists of the following key components:

- `lib.rs`: This file contains the code being tested, including the `compute_answer_to_be_tested_from_tests_package` function, which demonstrates normal assertion codes. Additionally, it includes the `BigComputer` and `get_answer` codes, which illustrate how to perform testing with mocking.
- `tests` directory: Here, you'll find the unit tests for the code present in `lib.rs`.
  - `compute_answer_test.rs`: This file showcases a simple test case that verifies whether the `compute_answer_to_be_tested_from_tests_package` function returns the anticipated value of 42.

To facilitate mocking in the tests, the `Cargo.toml` file for this module incorporates the `mockall` dependency.

To execute the tests for this module, simply navigate to the `rust_tdd_example_study_1` directory and run the following command:

```bash
cargo test
