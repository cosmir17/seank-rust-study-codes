The error you're encountering is because the Vehicle trait is a dynamically sized type (DST). In Rust, traits are unsized by default, which means that the size of a trait object is not known at compile time.

When you declare a variable let t: Vehicle;, Rust expects the size of t to be known at compile time. However, since Vehicle is a trait and not a concrete type, the compiler doesn't know the size of the object that will be stored in t.

To fix this issue, you have a few options:

Use a reference to the trait object:
rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: &dyn Vehicle;
}
By using &dyn Vehicle, you're creating a reference to a trait object, which has a known size (the size of a reference).

Use a Box to store the trait object:
rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: Box<dyn Vehicle>;
}
Box is a smart pointer that allows you to allocate the trait object on the heap, giving it a known size.

Use a concrete type that implements the Vehicle trait:
rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: Truck = Truck;
}
In this case, Truck is a concrete type that implements the Vehicle trait, so its size is known at compile time.

Choose the option that best fits your needs based on how you intend to use the Vehicle trait and its implementers in your code.

I have several questions :

You stated that '&dyn Vehicle, you're creating a reference to a trait object'. I haven't initialised an object of Vehicle. What does '&dyn' mean?
'let t: Box<dyn Vehicle>;', How can I allocate an object to somewhere that I haven't initialised?
How can 'allocating to heap' make it known size? why can't I know the size in the stack?
Great questions! Let's address them one by one.

&dyn Vehicle is a reference to a trait object. In Rust, dyn is a keyword used to create a trait object, which is a way to represent a value that implements a specific trait, without knowing the concrete type at compile time. When you write &dyn Vehicle, you're creating a reference to a value that implements the Vehicle trait. The actual object that implements Vehicle doesn't need to be initialized at this point. The reference &dyn Vehicle can later be assigned to refer to any object that implements the Vehicle trait. For example:
rust


Copy code
let truck = Truck;
let vehicle_ref: &dyn Vehicle = &truck;
Here, vehicle_ref is a reference to a Vehicle trait object, and it refers to the Truck instance truck.
When you write let t: Box<dyn Vehicle>;, you're declaring a variable t that will hold a Box containing a trait object of type dyn Vehicle. At this point, you're not allocating any memory or initializing an object. You're just specifying the type of t. To actually allocate an object and store it in the Box, you need to assign a value to t. For example:
rust


Copy code
let truck = Truck;
let t: Box<dyn Vehicle> = Box::new(truck);
Here, truck is an instance of Truck, and Box::new(truck) creates a new Box that owns the Truck instance. The Box is then assigned to t.
Allocating on the heap allows the size to be determined at runtime, whereas the size of stack-allocated values must be known at compile time. When you allocate an object on the heap using Box, the actual object is stored on the heap, and the Box itself is a small fixed-size pointer that refers to the heap-allocated object. The size of the Box is known at compile time, regardless of the size of the object it points to. In contrast, when you try to store a trait object directly on the stack, like let t: dyn Vehicle;, the compiler doesn't know the actual size of the object at compile time because the size of a trait object depends on the concrete type that implements the trait. Trait objects are dynamically dispatched, meaning the specific implementation is determined at runtime. By using Box<dyn Vehicle>, you're effectively storing a pointer to the trait object on the stack, while the actual object is allocated on the heap. This allows the size of t to be known at compile time, even though the size of the underlying object may vary.
I hope this clarifies your questions! Let me know if you have any further doubts.

I still can't get my head around

what dyn does
what is 'a reference to dyn' (&dyn)
I apologize for the confusion. Let me try to explain dyn and &dyn in more detail.

dyn keyword: In Rust, dyn is a keyword used to create dynamic trait objects. A trait object is a way to represent a value that implements a specific trait, without knowing the concrete type at compile time. When you use dyn followed by a trait name, like dyn Vehicle, you're creating a trait object. The actual type of the value stored in the trait object is not known at compile time, but it is guaranteed to implement the specified trait. Trait objects allow you to use dynamic dispatch, which means the specific implementation of the trait methods is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the value stored in the trait object. Example:
rust


Copy code
let vehicle: Box<dyn Vehicle> = Box::new(Truck);
Here, vehicle is a Box that holds a trait object of type dyn Vehicle. The actual value stored in the Box is an instance of Truck, but the specific type is not known at compile time. The vehicle variable can be used to call methods defined in the Vehicle trait on the stored value.
&dyn (reference to a trait object): &dyn is used to create a reference to a trait object. It combines the & (reference) operator with the dyn keyword. When you have a reference to a trait object, like &dyn Vehicle, it means you have a reference to a value that implements the Vehicle trait, without knowing the concrete type of the value. Example:
rust


Copy code
let truck = Truck;
let vehicle_ref: &dyn Vehicle = &truck;
In this case, vehicle_ref is a reference to a Vehicle trait object. It refers to the Truck instance truck. The specific type of truck is not known at compile time, but it is guaranteed to implement the Vehicle trait. References to trait objects are useful when you want to pass around values that implement a specific trait, without transferring ownership or moving the values.
The main difference between dyn Vehicle and &dyn Vehicle is that dyn Vehicle represents a trait object itself, while &dyn Vehicle represents a reference to a trait object.

Trait objects and references to trait objects are used when you want to work with values based on their trait implementations, rather than their concrete types. They provide a way to achieve polymorphism and dynamic dispatch in Rust.

I hope this explanation clarifies the concepts of dyn and &dyn. Let me know if you have any further questions!

Why can't I do :


Copy code
let t: dyn Vehicle = Truck;
In Rust, you cannot directly assign a concrete type to a trait object using the syntax let t: dyn Vehicle = Truck;. There are a few reasons why this is not allowed:

Size: Trait objects are unsized because the size of the concrete type implementing the trait is not known at compile time. When you declare a variable with a trait object type like let t: dyn Vehicle, the compiler doesn't know how much memory to allocate for t because the size of the concrete type (Truck in this case) is not known.
Trait object representation: Trait objects are represented as a pair of pointers: a pointer to the data (the actual value implementing the trait) and a pointer to a virtual method table (vtable) that contains the addresses of the trait methods for the specific type. The vtable is used for dynamic dispatch at runtime. When you directly assign a concrete type to a trait object, the compiler doesn't have the necessary information to create this representation.
To create a trait object, you need to use one of the following methods:

Box<dyn Trait>:
rust


Copy code
let t: Box<dyn Vehicle> = Box::new(Truck);
By using a Box, you allocate the trait object on the heap, and the Box itself has a known size (a pointer). The Box owns the value and is responsible for deallocating the memory when it goes out of scope.
&dyn Trait:
rust


Copy code
let truck = Truck;
let t: &dyn Vehicle = &truck;
By using a reference &, you create a reference to a trait object. The reference points to the actual value implementing the trait, and the lifetime of the reference is tied to the lifetime of the value it refers to.
Rc<dyn Trait> or Arc<dyn Trait>:
rust


Copy code
use std::rc::Rc;
let t: Rc<dyn Vehicle> = Rc::new(Truck);
Rc and Arc are reference-counting smart pointers that allow multiple ownership of the trait object. They are used when you need shared ownership of the trait object.
In all these cases, the trait object is created by using a pointer or a reference to the concrete type, rather than directly assigning the concrete type to the trait object.

I hope this helps clarify why let t: dyn Vehicle = Truck; is not allowed and provides alternative ways to create trait objects in Rust.

You stated 'because the size of the concrete type (Truck in this case) is not known.', how come the size of a concrete type is not known? it's a concrete type

I apologize for the confusion in my previous explanation. You are correct that the size of a concrete type, such as Truck, is known at compile time. Let me clarify.

The reason why let t: dyn Vehicle = Truck; is not allowed is not because the size of Truck is unknown, but because the size of the trait object dyn Vehicle is unknown at compile time.

When you create a trait object, the actual type behind the trait object can be any type that implements the specified trait. The size of the trait object depends on the size of the concrete type that implements the trait. Since the trait object can potentially hold values of different concrete types with different sizes, the size of the trait object itself is not known at compile time.

In Rust, variables and data structures stored on the stack must have a known size at compile time. This is why you cannot directly assign a concrete type to a trait object using let t: dyn Vehicle = Truck;. The compiler needs to know the size of t to allocate the appropriate memory on the stack, but the size of dyn Vehicle is not known at compile time.

To overcome this, you need to use a pointer or a reference to the trait object, such as Box<dyn Vehicle>, &dyn Vehicle, or Rc<dyn Vehicle>, as I mentioned in my previous response. These pointer types have a known size (the size of a pointer) and can be stored on the stack, while the actual trait object is allocated on the heap or referenced by the pointer.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous explanation. The size of a concrete type like Truck is indeed known at compile time, but the size of a trait object dyn Vehicle is not.

S
what is an trait object?

A trait object in Rust is a way to represent a value that implements a specific trait, without knowing the concrete type of the value at compile time. It allows you to work with values based on their shared behavior defined by a trait, rather than their specific types.

Trait objects are created by combining the dyn keyword with a trait name, such as dyn Vehicle. They are used when you want to store or pass around values that implement a particular trait, but the actual types of those values can vary.

Here are a few key points about trait objects:

Dynamic dispatch: Trait objects use dynamic dispatch, which means that the specific implementation of the trait methods is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the value stored in the trait object. This is in contrast to static dispatch, where the specific implementation is determined at compile time.
Pointers or references: Trait objects are typically used through pointers or references, such as &dyn Trait, Box<dyn Trait>, or Rc<dyn Trait>. This is because the size of a trait object is not known at compile time, as it can hold values of different types with potentially different sizes.
Virtual method table (vtable): Trait objects are represented internally as a pair of pointers: a pointer to the actual data (the value implementing the trait) and a pointer to a virtual method table (vtable). The vtable contains the addresses of the trait methods for the specific type, allowing dynamic dispatch at runtime.
Trait requirements: To create a trait object, the trait must meet certain requirements. The most notable requirement is that the trait must have object-safe methods. Object-safe methods are those that don't rely on the specific type of self and can be called on trait objects.
Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of trait objects:

rust


Copy code
trait Animal {
    fn sound(&self);
}

struct Dog;
impl Animal for Dog {
    fn sound(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

struct Cat;
impl Animal for Cat {
    fn sound(&self) {
        println!("Meow!");
    }
}

fn make_sound(animal: &dyn Animal) {
    animal.sound();
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;

    make_sound(&dog);  // Output: Woof!
    make_sound(&cat);  // Output: Meow!
}
In this example, the Animal trait defines a common behavior (sound) that can be implemented by different types (Dog and Cat). The make_sound function takes a reference to a trait object (&dyn Animal) and calls the sound method on it. The specific implementation of sound is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the value passed to make_sound.

Trait objects provide a way to achieve polymorphism and dynamic dispatch in Rust, allowing you to work with values based on their shared behavior defined by a trait.

    let a = Truck;
    t = &a;

How come the following doesn't work?


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: dyn Vehicle;
    let a = Truck;
    t = a;
}
I got the following error message :

"""

The reason why the second code snippet doesn't work is related to the concept of "sized" types in Rust.

In Rust, every type has a size that must be known at compile time. This is necessary for the compiler to allocate the appropriate amount of memory for variables and perform various optimizations. The Sized trait is automatically implemented for types whose size is known at compile time.

However, trait objects, such as dyn Vehicle, are unsized types. The size of a trait object is not known at compile time because it can hold values of different concrete types that may have different sizes. Therefore, the Sized trait is not implemented for trait objects.

In the first code snippet that works:

rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: &dyn Vehicle;
    let a = Truck;
    t = &a;
}
Here, t is declared as a reference to a trait object (&dyn Vehicle). References have a known size (the size of a pointer) and can be used to refer to unsized types. When you assign &a to t, you are creating a reference to the Truck instance a, which is a valid trait object of type &dyn Vehicle.

In the second code snippet that doesn't work:

rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: dyn Vehicle;
    let a = Truck;
    t = a;
}
Here, t is declared as a trait object directly (dyn Vehicle), without using a reference. However, as mentioned earlier, trait objects are unsized types and cannot be directly assigned to variables. The compiler raises an error because it cannot determine the size of t at compile time.

To fix this, you need to use a reference or a pointer to the trait object, as shown in the first code snippet or in the error message suggestion:

rust


Copy code
let t: &dyn Vehicle;
Alternatively, you can use other pointer types like Box<dyn Vehicle> or Rc<dyn Vehicle> to allocate the trait object on the heap and have a known size for the pointer.

rust


Copy code
let t: Box<dyn Vehicle> = Box::new(Truck);
In summary, the second code snippet doesn't work because trait objects are unsized types and cannot be directly assigned to variables. You need to use references or pointers to work with trait objects, as they have a known size and can refer to unsized types.

You stated : “trait objects are unsized types and cannot be directly assigned to variables.”. Truck is a struct type not an trait object.

You're absolutely right, and I apologize for my confusion in the previous response. Let me clarify.

In the second code snippet:

rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: dyn Vehicle;
    let a = Truck;
    t = a;
}
The issue is not with assigning Truck to a variable, but with assigning Truck directly to a trait object dyn Vehicle.

Here's the correct explanation:

Truck is indeed a struct type and has a known size at compile time. It can be assigned to variables without any issues.

However, t is declared as a trait object dyn Vehicle, which is an unsized type. Trait objects are unsized because they can hold values of different concrete types that may have different sizes. The size of a trait object is not known at compile time.

When you try to assign a (which is of type Truck) directly to t (which is of type dyn Vehicle), the compiler raises an error because it cannot directly assign a concrete type to a trait object. Trait objects are typically used through references or pointers.

To fix this, you need to use a reference or a pointer to create a trait object:

rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: &dyn Vehicle = &Truck;
    // or
    let t: Box<dyn Vehicle> = Box::new(Truck);
}
In these cases, &Truck creates a reference to a Truck instance, and Box::new(Truck) creates a Box pointer to a Truck instance, both of which can be assigned to the respective trait object types &dyn Vehicle and Box<dyn Vehicle>.

I apologize for my previous confusion and any misunderstanding it may have caused. Thank you for pointing out the mistake, and I hope this clarifies the issue.

How is Sized trait implemented and get connected to such operations I stated above?

The Sized trait in Rust is a special trait that indicates whether a type has a known size at compile time. It is automatically implemented by the compiler for types whose size is known at compile time, such as primitive types, structs, enums, and arrays with a fixed size.

The Sized trait is important because Rust needs to know the size of types at compile time to perform various operations, such as memory allocation, stack and heap storage, and passing values between functions. When a type implements Sized, it means that the compiler can determine its size and perform these operations correctly.

In the context of the code snippets we discussed earlier:

rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: &dyn Vehicle;
    let a = Truck;
    t = &a;
}
Here's how the Sized trait comes into play:

Truck is a struct type, and structs implement the Sized trait by default. This means that the size of Truck is known at compile time.
dyn Vehicle is a trait object, which is an unsized type. Trait objects do not implement the Sized trait because their size is not known at compile time. The actual size of a trait object depends on the concrete type it holds, which can vary.
When you declare let t: &dyn Vehicle, you are creating a reference to a trait object. References (&T) in Rust have a known size (the size of a pointer) and can refer to both sized and unsized types. In this case, t is a reference to a trait object of type dyn Vehicle.
When you assign &a to t, you are creating a reference to the Truck instance a. Since Truck implements Sized, creating a reference to it is valid. The reference &a is then assigned to t, which is of type &dyn Vehicle. This is allowed because &a satisfies the trait object requirement of &dyn Vehicle.
Now, let's consider the second code snippet that doesn't compile:

rust


Copy code
fn main() {
    let t: dyn Vehicle;
    let a = Truck;
    t = a;
}
In this case:

Truck is a sized type, as explained earlier.
dyn Vehicle is an unsized type, as it is a trait object.
When you declare let t: dyn Vehicle, you are trying to directly create a trait object. However, since dyn Vehicle is unsized and does not implement Sized, the compiler raises an error. It cannot determine the size of t at compile time.
Assigning a (of type Truck) directly to t (of type dyn Vehicle) is not allowed because it would involve directly assigning a sized type to an unsized type, which is not permitted in Rust.
To work with trait objects, you need to use references or pointers (&dyn Trait, Box<dyn Trait>, Rc<dyn Trait>, etc.) because they have a known size and can refer to unsized types.

The Sized trait is automatically implemented by the compiler and is used implicitly in various operations and type checks. It ensures that the compiler has the necessary size information to perform memory allocation, storage, and passing of values correctly.

show me how Sized trait is implemented.

The Sized trait is a special trait in Rust that is automatically implemented by the compiler for types whose size is known at compile time. It is not implemented explicitly in the source code like other traits.

However, for the purpose of understanding, let's imagine how the Sized trait might be defined in Rust's standard library:

rust


Copy code
#[lang = "sized"]
#[fundamental]
pub trait Sized {}
This is a simplified representation of the Sized trait. The #[lang = "sized"] attribute indicates that it is a language-defined trait, and the #[fundamental] attribute marks it as a fundamental trait that is automatically implemented by the compiler.

The Sized trait is an auto trait, which means it is automatically implemented for types that satisfy certain conditions. In this case, the condition is that the size of the type must be known at compile time.

The compiler automatically implements Sized for the following types:

Primitive types (i32, f64, bool, etc.)
Struct types where all fields are Sized
Enum types where all variants are Sized
Array types with a fixed size ([T; N])
Tuple types where all elements are Sized
Function types
Reference types (&T, &mut T)
Raw pointer types (*const T, *mut T)
The Sized trait does not have any methods or associated types. Its purpose is to serve as a marker trait to indicate whether a type has a known size at compile time.

When the Sized trait is used as a bound on a type parameter, like T: Sized, it restricts the type parameter to only accept types that implement Sized. This is the default bound for type parameters in Rust, so it is often omitted.

For example, the following function generic over T requires T to be Sized:

rust


Copy code
fn foo<T>(x: T) {
    // ...
}
In this case, T must be a type that implements Sized, which means its size must be known at compile time.

On the other hand, if you want to allow a type parameter to accept both sized and unsized types, you can use the ?Sized bound:

rust


Copy code
fn bar<T: ?Sized>(x: &T) {
    // ...
}
Here, T can be either a sized type or an unsized type, such as a trait object.

It's important to note that you cannot directly use Sized in your code like other traits. It is a compiler-defined trait that is automatically implemented and used by the compiler for type checking and memory management.
