in rust, 'i' and 'u' are used as a prefix in front of primitive types indicating if it's unsigned or signed.

You're correct! In Rust, the prefixes i and u are used to indicate whether a primitive integer type is signed or unsigned, respectively.

i prefix: Indicates a signed integer type, which can represent both positive and negative numbers. For example, i8, i16, i32, i64, and i128 are signed integer types with varying bit sizes.
u prefix: Indicates an unsigned integer type, which can only represent non-negative numbers (zero and positive numbers). For example, u8, u16, u32, u64, and u128 are unsigned integer types with varying bit sizes.
Here's an example demonstrating the usage of signed and unsigned integers in Rust:

rust


Copy code
let signed_num: i32 = -10;
let unsigned_num: u32 = 42;

println!("Signed number: {}", signed_num);
println!("Unsigned number: {}", unsigned_num);
Output:


Copy code
Signed number: -10
Unsigned number: 42
In this example, signed_num is declared as a signed 32-bit integer (i32) and can hold negative values, while unsigned_num is declared as an unsigned 32-bit integer (u32) and can only hold non-negative values.

Rust also provides a default integer type isize and usize, which are signed and unsigned integer types, respectively, with a size that depends on the architecture of the platform (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit).

Using the appropriate integer type based on the range of values you need to represent helps ensure proper memory usage and prevents unexpected behavior when dealing with negative numbers.

I understand 'u' means unsigned. how come 'i' mean signed?

The use of i to represent signed integers in Rust is a convention that has its roots in the C programming language. In C, the int keyword is used to declare signed integers, and the unsigned keyword is used to declare unsigned integers.

When Rust was designed, the developers chose to use a more explicit and concise notation for integer types. Instead of using the full keywords int and unsigned, they opted for the shorter prefixes i and u to indicate signedness.

The choice of i for signed integers is likely influenced by the fact that int starts with the letter 'i'. It serves as a mnemonic to associate i with int and, consequently, with signed integers.

While the use of i for signed integers might seem arbitrary, it has become an established convention in Rust and is consistently used throughout the language and its ecosystem. It provides a clear and concise way to differentiate between signed and unsigned integer types.

It's worth noting that this convention is specific to Rust and may differ in other programming languages. For example, in some languages, the prefix s is used for signed integers, while u is still used for unsigned integers.

Ultimately, the choice of i for signed integers in Rust is a design decision that aims to provide a consistent and memorable notation for integer types in the language.
