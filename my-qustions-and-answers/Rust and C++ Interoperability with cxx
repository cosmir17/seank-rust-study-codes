Rust c++ interoperability, what is cxx

cxx is a tool that enables seamless interoperability between Rust and C++. It allows you to define a common interface in both languages and generate the necessary bindings to facilitate communication between Rust and C++ code.

Key features of cxx:

Shared API: You can define a shared API using a custom interface definition language (IDL) that is understood by both Rust and C++. This IDL is used to specify functions, types, and data structures that can be used across the language boundary.
Code generation: cxx automatically generates Rust and C++ code based on the shared API definition. It creates the necessary bindings, wrappers, and abstractions to enable smooth interoperability between the two languages.
Safety: cxx ensures that the interaction between Rust and C++ is safe and prevents common pitfalls such as null pointer dereferences, use-after-free, and other memory-related issues. It leverages Rust's ownership and borrowing system to maintain memory safety across the language boundary.
Performance: cxx aims to provide efficient and low-overhead interoperability between Rust and C++. It minimizes the cost of crossing the language boundary and allows for direct access to data structures and functions without unnecessary indirection.
Build integration: cxx integrates with existing build systems commonly used in Rust and C++ projects, such as Cargo and CMake. It simplifies the build process and ensures that the generated code is properly compiled and linked.
By using cxx, you can take advantage of the strengths of both Rust and C++. You can write performance-critical or low-level code in C++ and leverage Rust's safety and concurrency features for higher-level logic. cxx enables you to gradually integrate Rust into existing C++ codebases or build new projects that combine the best of both languages.

To use cxx, you typically define the shared API in a separate file with a ".cxx" extension. Then, you use the cxx build tool to generate the necessary Rust and C++ code. The generated code can be included in your Rust and C++ source files, allowing you to call functions and use types across the language boundary seamlessly.

cxx has gained popularity in the Rust community as it provides a practical and efficient way to interoperate with C++ code, which is widely used in many existing libraries and systems.

What is bindgen?

bindgen is a tool that automatically generates Rust FFI (Foreign Function Interface) bindings to C and C++ libraries. It allows Rust code to easily call functions and use types defined in C and C++ headers.

Key features of bindgen:

Automatic binding generation: bindgen takes a C or C++ header file as input and generates corresponding Rust code that provides a safe and idiomatic interface to the exported functions, types, and constants.
Type translation: bindgen maps C and C++ types to their Rust equivalents. It handles primitive types, structs, enums, unions, function pointers, and more. It also generates appropriate Rust representations for complex C++ constructs like templates and overloaded functions.
Configurability: bindgen provides various configuration options and annotations to control the generated bindings. You can specify which functions and types to include or exclude, rename identifiers, define custom type mappings, and more.
Integration with build systems: bindgen can be easily integrated into Rust's build system, such as Cargo, using build scripts. It can automatically detect and locate the required C and C++ headers and libraries.
Safety: bindgen generates safe Rust code that takes care of memory management and ownership. It ensures that the generated bindings follow Rust's borrowing rules and prevent common memory-related issues like null pointer dereferences and use-after-free.
The main difference between bindgen and cxx is their approach to interoperability:

bindgen generates Rust bindings that directly call C and C++ functions and use C and C++ types. It relies on the Rust FFI mechanism and requires minimal changes to the existing C and C++ code.
cxx, on the other hand, defines a shared interface using a custom IDL and generates both Rust and C++ code to facilitate communication between the two languages. It requires modifying the C++ code to use the cxx-generated bindings.
bindgen is particularly useful when you have an existing C or C++ library that you want to use in Rust without modifying the library itself. It allows you to quickly generate Rust bindings and start using the library from Rust code.

To use bindgen, you typically create a build script in your Rust project that invokes bindgen with the appropriate configuration and header files. bindgen then generates the Rust bindings, which you can include in your Rust code using the include! macro.

bindgen has become a popular choice for integrating Rust with existing C and C++ codebases, especially when direct access to the C and C++ APIs is required and modifying the existing code is not feasible or desired.
