What is rust analyzer?

Rust Analyzer is a language server for the Rust programming language. It provides IDE-like features and assists developers in writing Rust code by offering the following functionality:

Code completion: It suggests completions for variable names, functions, methods, and more as you type.
Go to definition: It allows you to navigate to the definition of a symbol (function, struct, enum, etc.) by clicking on it or using a keyboard shortcut.
Type information: It shows the type of a variable or expression when hovering over it.
Error diagnostics: It analyzes the code and provides real-time error diagnostics, highlighting potential issues and offering suggestions for fixing them.
Code formatting: It can automatically format Rust code according to the standard style guidelines.
Refactoring: It supports various refactoring operations, such as renaming symbols, extracting functions, and more.
Code lens: It provides additional information and actions inline with the code, such as showing the number of references to a symbol or offering to run tests.
Rust Analyzer is built using the Rust compiler's libraries and aims to provide a fast and reliable editing experience for Rust developers. It is available as a plugin or extension for popular IDEs and text editors, such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Vim, and Emacs.

By leveraging Rust Analyzer, developers can benefit from enhanced productivity, better code navigation, and early detection of potential errors, making the development process more efficient and enjoyable.
