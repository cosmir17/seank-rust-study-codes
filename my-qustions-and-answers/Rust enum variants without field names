I have the following Rust code :


Copy code
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use std::sync::Arc;
pub mod utils;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize, PartialEq)] // partialEq that is used to define partial equality between two values of the same type
//it's often used to implement comparison operators such as ==, != signs
pub enum Client {
    Join { //how come they don't have field name?, it's called variant
        chat_name: Arc<String>
    },
    Post { //post variant
        chat_name: Arc<String>,
        message: Arc<String>
    }
}

pub enum Server {
    Message {
        chat_name: Arc<String>,
        message: Arc<String>
    },
    Error(String)
}
Why don't these enums have field names?

In Rust, enum variants can be defined in different ways, and the variants in your code are using a specific syntax called "tuple variants" or "tuple-like variants."

In the Client enum, the variants Join and Post are defined using tuple-like syntax. Instead of having named fields, they have unnamed fields enclosed in curly braces {}. The types of the fields are specified directly without field names.

Similarly, in the Server enum, the Message variant is also defined using tuple-like syntax, with unnamed fields enclosed in curly braces.

When using tuple-like variants, you can access the fields by their position rather than by name. For example, if you have an instance of Client::Join, you can access the chat_name field using client.0 (assuming client is the variable holding the enum instance).

Tuple-like variants are useful when the meaning of the fields is clear from the context and the order of the fields is important. They provide a concise way to define variants with unnamed fields.

On the other hand, the Error variant in the Server enum is defined using a different syntax called "struct-like variant" or "record-like variant." It has a named field String without specifying a field name. This variant is essentially a tuple variant with a single field of type String.

So, in summary, the enum variants in your code don't have field names because they are defined using tuple-like syntax, where the fields are unnamed and accessed by their position.

I have the following Rust code :

        message: Arc<String>
    }
}

        chat_name: Arc<String>,
        message: Arc<String>
    },
    Error(String)
}
Why don't these Enums have field names?

In Rust, enum variants can be defined in different ways, and in your code, the variants are using tuple-like syntax without explicit field names.

In the Client enum, the variants Join and Post are defined using tuple-like syntax. They don't have explicit field names, but the fields are specified by their types within curly braces {}.

Similarly, in the Server enum, the Message variant is defined using tuple-like syntax without explicit field names.

When using tuple-like syntax, the fields are accessed by their position rather than by name. For example, to access the chat_name field of the Join variant, you would use client.0 (assuming client is an instance of the Client enum with the Join variant).

However, you can also define enum variants with named fields, like this:

rust


Copy code
pub enum Client {
    Join {
        chat_name: Arc<String>,
    },
    Post {
        chat_name: Arc<String>,
        message: Arc<String>,
    },
}

pub enum Server {
    Message {
        chat_name: Arc<String>,
        message: Arc<String>,
    },
    Error(String),
}
In this case, the Join, Post, and Message variants have named fields, and you can access the fields using dot notation, like client.chat_name or server.message.

The choice between using tuple-like syntax or named fields depends on your preference and the clarity of your code. Named fields can make the code more readable and self-explanatory, while tuple-like syntax can be more concise.
